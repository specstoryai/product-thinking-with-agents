# Building TnyOffice: From "GDocs for Markdown" to Real-Time Collaboration

## Session 1: The Intuition

*July 19, 2025, 6:00 PM EDT*

It started with a simple intuition: "There needs to be something like Google Docs for markdown."

That was the entire pitch I brought to ChatGPT on a Friday evening. Not a technical specification, not a business plan—just a feeling that something was missing in how we create and collaborate on technical documentation.

The response was immediate and energizing. ChatGPT crystallized my vague intuition into a concrete product thesis:

> "A multiplayer Markdown workspace that feels like Google Docs, round-trips like Git, and publishes like a static site generator—without leaving the editor."

### Why This Felt Right

The conversation quickly surfaced why this gap existed:

**Markdown is already universal**—it's the lingua franca for READMEs, specs, documentation, and developer writing. It lives naturally in git repositories. It's future-proof and portable. But despite being everywhere, markdown tools were stuck in single-player mode.

**Collaboration was the missing piece**. Most markdown editors nail the authoring experience or the publishing pipeline, but none delivered Google-grade multiplayer editing—live cursors, comments that stick to content, suggestions and approvals, real-time presence. You either got great solo tools (Obsidian, Typora) or you abandoned markdown entirely for proprietary formats (Notion, Google Docs).

**The doc-as-code movement needed a bridge**. Teams wanted documentation that lived next to their code, version-controlled and diffable. But they also needed non-technical contributors—product managers, designers, stakeholders—to participate without learning git.

### The Technical Challenges

ChatGPT didn't sugarcoat the complexity. Building "GDocs for markdown" meant solving several hard problems:

1. **Track changes on plain text is hard**. Comments and suggestions need to anchor to specific ranges of text. But when text changes, those anchors drift or break. Google Docs solves this with a proprietary format—we'd need to solve it while keeping files as pure `.md`.

2. **Markdown's simplicity fights rich features**. Tables, footnotes, embeds, math equations—they all get awkward in raw markdown. We'd need a rich editing layer that could still round-trip cleanly to plain text.

3. **Real-time collaboration requires CRDTs or Operational Transforms**. The suggestion was clear: use something like Yjs or Automerge for conflict-free collaborative editing. Comments would need to anchor to AST nodes, not character offsets.

4. **The competition was "good enough"**. Many tools did parts of this well. To win, the combination had to be meaningfully better, not just tidier.

### The MVP Vision

What emerged from that first conversation was surprisingly concrete thanks to a bunch of prior chat history I had loaded up:

- **Editor core**: CodeMirror 6 + Yjs/Automerge for real-time collaboration
- **Clean publishing**: Markdown to static HTML with one elegant theme
- **Perfect import/export**: No lock-in, no proprietary markers
- **Comments that survive**: Anchored to AST nodes, not character positions

The traps to avoid were equally clear:
- Don't go MDX-everywhere (kills portability)
- Don't let comments drift (anchor to structure, not position)
- Don't hide proprietary glue in the files (no lock-in in disguise)

## Session 2: From Vision to First API

*July 19, 2025, 6:41 PM EDT*

Fresh from the ChatGPT brainstorm, I opened Claude Code with a simple request: "This will be a monorepo with multiple separate but related Next.js apps."

The conversation quickly revealed a fundamental architectural decision that would shape everything: **Where should shared API routes live?**

Claude initially suggested the typical patterns—shared packages, reusable utilities. But I had something specific in mind: "If I have shared API for persisting and retrieving files that's used across all the apps?"

That's when the architecture crystallized. Instead of duplicating API routes across apps or creating complex shared packages, we'd build a **dedicated API service**—a standalone Next.js app that would handle all file operations for the entire ecosystem.

```
tnyOffice/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/        # Centralized API service
│   └── docs/       # Documentation app
└── packages/       # Shared utilities
```

### The Git Repository Dance

One of those moments that reveals the AI's assumptions: Claude created the monorepo structure perfectly, but when I checked, each app had its own git repository. 

"I don't like that," I told Claude. "We want a single git repo for the monorepo."

This small friction point highlighted something important about working with AI tools—they make reasonable assumptions based on common patterns (many monorepos do have separate git repos), but your specific needs might differ. The fix was quick: remove the individual `.git` folders, initialize a single repo at the root, and create a proper `.gitignore` for the monorepo.

### From Plan to Implementation

What struck me about this session was the methodical approach. First, we created a plan—literally a markdown file at `/apps/api/plans/init_api_plan.md`:

```markdown
## Markdown File API Plan

### Overview
Dead simple create/read API for markdown files with clean, versioned routes.

#### Base URL
`/api/v1`

#### Endpoints
- POST /api/v1/files - Create markdown file
- GET /api/v1/files/:id - Get file by ID
- GET /api/v1/files - List all files
```

Then, in the same session, we implemented it. Not tomorrow, not after a design review—immediately. The storage utilities, validation schemas with Zod, and all three endpoints came together in under an hour.

### The Interactive Documentation Twist

But here's where it got interesting. Instead of just building an API, I asked Claude to "replace the page.tsx of the initial Next.js app with a new page that offers basic and simple API documentation UI along with a way to test API calls right from that doc page."

The result was surprisingly sophisticated—a fully interactive API documentation page with:
- Tabbed interface for different endpoints
- Live testing capabilities
- Response visualization with timing metrics
- Dark mode support
- Inline validation rules and error codes

This wasn't in the original plan. It emerged from the conversation, from the back-and-forth of "what if we could test it right here?"

### The Power of Incremental Decisions

Looking back at this session, what stands out is how each decision built on the previous one:

1. **Monorepo structure** → enables shared code without complexity
2. **Dedicated API service** → centralizes file operations
3. **Plan before code** → ensures clear intent
4. **Interactive documentation** → makes the API immediately usable

Each choice was small, reversible, and focused. We didn't try to build the entire collaborative editor in one session. We built a foundation—a simple API that could store and retrieve markdown files.

### The First Commit

The session ended with a git commit that captured it all:

```
Initial commit: TnyOffice monorepo setup

- Monorepo structure with apps/ and packages/ directories
- API service app for centralized file management
- Documentation app for collaborative markdown editing
- Workspace configuration with npm workspaces
- Basic README and gitignore
```

42 files changed, 7,564 insertions. The foundation was laid.

### The Missing Piece

But there was something conspicuously absent from this first implementation: **real-time collaboration**. The API could store files, retrieve them, list them—but it couldn't handle multiple users editing the same document simultaneously.

That would require something more sophisticated than REST endpoints. It would require WebSockets, CRDTs, and a complete rethinking of how documents are stored and synchronized.


---

## Session 3: The Small Details That Matter

*July 19, 2025, 8:40 PM EDT*

Friday evening, just a couple hours after setting up the monorepo, I shared a screenshot with Claude—a simple logging wrapper that checked `NODE_ENV` before outputting to console. "Let's think about a slightly better logging approach than console.log," I said. "It should be the same approach across the monorepo."

This wasn't about building complex logging infrastructure. It was about recognizing that even in a prototype, certain patterns set the foundation for everything that follows.

### The Logger That Respects Production

The implementation was deliberately simple:

```typescript
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

export const log = {
  info: (...args: any[]) => {
    if (!isProd) console.info('[INFO]', ...args)
  },
  warn: (...args: any[]) => {
    if (!isProd) console.warn('[WARN]', ...args)
  },
  error: (...args: any[]) => {
    console.error('[ERROR]', ...args)
  },
  debug: (...args: any[]) => {
    if (!isProd) console.debug('[DEBUG]', ...args)
  },
}
```

What made this interesting wasn't the code—it's about as basic as logging gets. It was the decision to make it a **shared package** from day one.

### The Monorepo Philosophy in Action

Claude immediately understood the assignment. Instead of adding logging utilities to each app individually, we created `packages/logger`—a shared package that both the API and docs apps could import as `@tnyoffice/logger`.

This small decision revealed the monorepo's power:
- **Consistency by default**: Every app logs the same way
- **Single source of truth**: One place to update logging behavior
- **Clear boundaries**: Apps consume packages, they don't share code directly

### The Linting Crusade

"Make sure we do good linting for this project," I requested. "Set up linting across the monorepo in such a way that we catch all the linting errors that could stop a Vercel deployment."

What followed was a methodical setup:
1. Root-level ESLint configuration
2. TypeScript checking across all packages
3. Turbo.json for orchestrating tasks
4. Scripts that would catch issues before deployment

Claude found and flagged every `console.log` statement across the codebase, replacing them with the new logger. It caught TypeScript any-types that would fail strict builds. It set up ignore patterns for generated files.

### The Philosophy of Small Things

This session wasn't glamorous. We didn't add any user-facing features. We didn't solve any complex technical challenges. We just:
- Replaced console.log with a environment-aware logger
- Set up proper linting and type checking
- Created our first shared package

But these small decisions compound. The logger that respects production becomes the foundation for proper observability. The linting that catches deployment issues becomes the safety net for rapid iteration. The shared package pattern becomes the template for extracting common functionality.

### The Hidden Architecture

Looking at the monorepo structure after this session:

```
tnyOffice/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/        # Uses @tnyoffice/logger
│   └── docs/       # Uses @tnyoffice/logger
├── packages/
│   └── logger/     # Shared logging utility
└── turbo.json      # Orchestrates builds, linting, type checking
```

Each piece had a purpose. Each boundary was intentional. The architecture was emerging not from a grand design document, but from small, practical decisions.

### The Vercel Consideration

Throughout the session, there was an undercurrent: "catch all the linting errors that could stop a Vercel deployment." This wasn't academic. The code needed to deploy cleanly, build without errors, run in production.

The linting wasn't about code style—it was about deployment reliability. The TypeScript checking wasn't about type purity—it was about runtime safety. The logger wasn't about debugging—it was about not leaking development logs to production.

### The Pattern Emerges

Three sessions in, a pattern was becoming clear:

1. **Start simple**: Basic API, basic UI, basic logging
2. **Extract commonality**: Shared packages for shared concerns
3. **Add guardrails**: Linting, types, environment awareness
4. **Think deployment**: Every decision considers production

But we still hadn't tackled the core challenge: real-time collaboration. The foundation was solid, the patterns were established, but the documents were still static files in a SQLite database.

The next session would change everything. It would introduce Automerge, WebSockets, and the complexity of distributed state. But it would build on this foundation—the logger would track sync operations, the linting would catch WebSocket issues, the monorepo structure would contain the complexity.

---

## Session 4: The Real-Time Ambition

*July 19, 2025, 8:45 PM EDT*

Just minutes after setting up the logger, I dropped a specification into Claude's context: "We want real-time multi-author update capabilities."

The ask was ambitious. I shared a plan for a "Real-Time Collaborative Markdown Editor Prototype" that invoked cr-sqlite, WebSockets, and CRDTs. The vision was clear:

> "Browser client ↔ WebSocket ↔ cr-sqlite backend"

Claude immediately understood the complexity and created a comprehensive plan—three weeks of implementation, six phases, from database layer to Git integration. It was thorough, professional, and exactly what you'd expect for a production system.

### The Reality Check

"Update it because there's no need to maintain backward compatibility with the existing API. We're prototyping."

That single comment changed everything. Claude immediately slashed the complexity:
- Three weeks became 3.5 days
- Six phases became simple steps
- Dual storage strategies disappeared
- Complex migration plans vanished

The revised plan focused on the essence: get multiple browsers editing the same document, use cr-sqlite's CRDT magic to handle conflicts, ship it.

### The Pivot to Simplicity

But even that wasn't simple enough. Twenty minutes into the conversation, I made a decisive call:

"Look at @README.md and @apps/api/README.md. We need to create a new basic nodejs app in this monorepo called api2. It's not a next app. Keep it simple."

No Next.js. No App Router. Just Express and SQLite.

Claude started building with sqlite3, but I pushed for modernity: "Use more up to date versions... better-sqlite3 12.2.0 instead of sqlite3."

### The Architecture Taking Shape

What emerged was interesting—a parallel API implementation:
- `apps/api` - The original Next.js API with file storage
- `apps/api2` - A simpler Express API with SQLite

Same endpoints, same functionality, different storage layer. This wasn't about replacing the original—it was about exploring alternatives, comparing approaches, finding the right foundation for real-time collaboration.

```javascript
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3003;

// Middleware
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

// Routes
app.use('/api/v1/files', filesRouter);
```

### The Philosophical Shift

This session revealed something important about building prototypes: **Sometimes you need to build it twice to build it right.**

The first API (Next.js + files) taught us the domain model. The second API (Express + SQLite) would teach us about persistence. Neither was wrong. Both were necessary steps toward understanding what we actually needed.

The cr-sqlite dream was still there in the plan, but we were taking a step back. Before we could build real-time collaboration with CRDTs, we needed to understand our data layer. SQLite first, then cr-sqlite. Walking before running.

### The Unfinished Business

The session ended with api2 partially built—the server was there, the package.json updated, but the database schema and routes were still to come. We had:

- An Express server ready to run on port 3003
- Better-sqlite3 as our database engine
- The same validation with Zod
- The same logger we'd just built

But no actual database implementation yet. No routes. No schema.

It was Friday night. The foundation was being laid, but the real work—making documents actually collaborative—was still ahead.

### The Pattern of Progress

Looking back, a pattern was emerging in how this project evolved:

1. **Dream big**: Real-time collaboration with CRDTs
2. **Plan thoroughly**: Three-week implementation plan
3. **Simplify ruthlessly**: "We're prototyping"
4. **Build incrementally**: Express + SQLite first
5. **Learn by doing**: Two APIs teaching different lessons

Each session built on the last, but not always in the direction you'd expect. Sometimes progress meant building sideways—creating alternatives, exploring options, learning what worked.

The collaborative editing dream was still alive. But first, we needed to get SQLite working.

---

## Session 5: The Late Night Deploy

*July 19, 2025, 11:37 PM EDT*

Three hours after starting the api2 project, I returned with a summary of our progress and a clear directive: "Let's do step 1 of this plan."

The plan had evolved. The Express API was now deployed on Fly.io. The SQLite database was working. We'd overcome deployment challenges—missing package-lock.json files (monorepo issues), logger package dependencies that wouldn't resolve in Docker, TypeScript compilation errors that only showed up in production builds.

But the real work was just beginning.

### The UPDATE Endpoint

Step 1 seemed simple: Add a PUT endpoint for updating files. Claude implemented it methodically:

```typescript
router.put('/:id', async (req: Request<{ id: string }, object, UpdateFileRequest>, res: Response<FileWithContent | ErrorResponse>) => {
  // Validate UUID, check existence, build dynamic update query
  // Update filename and/or content with updated_at timestamp
});
```

The implementation was clean—dynamic SQL query building that only updated the fields provided, automatic timestamp updates, proper validation with Zod. But I wanted more: "Can you include this new endpoint in testing page?"

### The Frontend Evolution

"This is great. Now let's do a basic change to @apps/docs/ app to take advantage of this, with editing ability and a save button."

What followed was a transformation of the DocumentViewer component. The read-only markdown viewer became a full editor:

- An Edit button that switched to edit mode
- Cancel to discard changes
- Save to persist them using the new PUT endpoint
- Proper state management for `isEditing`, `editedContent`, and `isSaving`

```typescript
const handleSave = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/v1/files/${documentId}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ content: editedContent }),
  });
  
  const updatedData = await response.json();
  setDocument(updatedData);
  setIsEditing(false);
};
```

The docs app now had full CRUD capabilities. Users could create, read, update, and list documents. The foundation was complete.

![Editor](./images/edit-doc.png)

### The cr-sqlite Pivot

"Let's move on to step 2. We don't actually need a migration script. If you run and find a database that's not using cr-sqlite just delete and recreate an empty one."

This was the moment where the real-time dream started to become concrete. cr-sqlite—Convergent, Replicated SQLite with CRDT support. Claude started researching, finding the `@vlcn.io/crsqlite` package, understanding how to load it as an extension with better-sqlite3.

```javascript
import Database from "better-sqlite3";
import { extensionPath } from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite";

const db = new Database(dbPath);
db.loadExtension(extensionPath);
```

But then, an error:

```
npm error command sh -c node ./nodejs-install-helper.js
npm error import pkg from "./package.json" assert { type: "json" };
```

### The Pattern of Progress

It was approaching midnight. We'd come so far from that Friday evening brainstorm:

1. **6:00 PM**: "GDocs for markdown" dream
2. **6:41 PM**: Monorepo foundation
3. **8:40 PM**: Logger and infrastructure
4. **8:45 PM**: Real-time ambitions and api2
5. **11:37 PM**: Deployed, updating, reaching for CRDTs

Each session built on the last, but also revealed new complexity. The cr-sqlite integration wasn't going to be straightforward. The package had installation issues. The extension loading had its own challenges.

### The State of Things

As Saturday approached, we had:
- A deployed API on Fly.io with full CRUD operations
- A frontend that could create, read, update, and list documents
- Edit/save functionality working smoothly
- The beginning of cr-sqlite integration

But not yet:
- Real-time synchronization
- Multiple users seeing each other's edits
- CRDT-based conflict resolution
- The collaborative experience we'd envisioned

The session ended with an npm error, a reminder that even the best-laid plans encounter reality. But the foundation was solid. The API was live. The editing worked. 

Tomorrow would bring new approaches to the cr-sqlite challenge. For now, it was time to sleep on it.


---

## Session 6: The Automerge Pivot

*July 20, 2025, 6:28 AM EDT*

Saturday morning. After the npm errors of the night before, I woke up with a different approach: "read @README.md @apps/api/README.md and @apps/docs/README.md then create a new plan in @apps/docs/plans/ called automerge_plan.md that uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/@automerge/automerge-codemirror"

The pivot from cr-sqlite to Automerge. Sometimes the best technical decision is recognizing when to change course.

### The Research Phase

Claude didn't just read the npm package description. It went deep, fetching the actual source code from GitHub:

- `plugin.ts` - The core ViewPlugin that syncs CodeMirror and Automerge
- `codeMirrorToAm.ts` - Converting CodeMirror transactions to Automerge changes
- `amToCodemirror.ts` - Converting Automerge patches to CodeMirror transactions
- `DocHandle.ts` - The interface for managing Automerge documents

This wasn't surface-level planning. Claude understood the bidirectional sync mechanism, the reconciliation flags, the patch application process. It grasped how `automergeSyncPlugin` would bridge two different document models.

### The Comprehensive Plan

What emerged wasn't just a technical specification—it was a complete transformation strategy for TnyOffice. The plan covered everything:

#### Architecture Evolution
```typescript
// From this (simple SQLite storage):
const doc = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM files WHERE id = ?').get(id);

// To this (CRDT-powered collaboration):
const docHandle = getDocumentHandle(documentId);
const syncPlugin = automergeSyncPlugin({
  handle: docHandle,
  path: ['content']
});
```

#### Three-Phase Implementation
1. **Backend Infrastructure**: WebSockets, Automerge documents, binary storage
2. **Frontend Integration**: CodeMirror plugin, document handles, sync protocol
3. **Synchronization Protocol**: Loading flows, real-time sync, persistence

The plan even included database migrations, WebSocket message formats, security considerations, and rollback strategies.

### The Reality Check

But what stood out most was the pragmatism:

- **Timeline**: 1.5-2 weeks for MVP (not months)
- **Success Metrics**: Sub-100ms sync latency, 10+ concurrent editors
- **Migration Strategy**: Backward compatible, gradual rollout
- **Testing Scenarios**: Offline/online transitions, conflict resolution, network interruptions

This wasn't academic. Every section addressed real problems:
- What happens when a user goes offline mid-edit?
- How do you handle server restarts with active connections?
- What about document size limits and performance?

### The Technical Depth

The plan showed deep understanding of both systems:

```typescript
// Client → Server messages
interface ClientMessage {
  type: 'subscribe' | 'unsubscribe' | 'sync';
  documentId: string;
  data?: Uint8Array; // Automerge sync data
}

// CodeMirror integration
extensions: [
  markdown(),
  syncPlugin,  // The magic happens here
  // ... other extensions
]
```

Each technical decision was justified. Binary format for efficiency. Lazy loading for performance. Batch messages for network optimization.

### The Vision Beyond MVP

The "Future Enhancements" section revealed the real ambition:
- **Presence Awareness**: See other users' cursors
- **Comments**: Inline discussions in documents
- **Version History**: Time travel through document states
- **Conflict Visualization**: See exactly how changes merged

This wasn't just about making documents sync. It was about building a collaborative experience that could rival Google Docs.

### The Pattern Continues

Saturday morning, 6:28 AM. Less than 13 hours after the initial brainstorm, the project had:
- Pivoted from file storage to SQLite
- Attempted cr-sqlite integration
- Hit roadblocks with package installation
- Pivoted again to Automerge
- Produced a comprehensive implementation plan

Each failure taught something. Each pivot refined the vision. The dream of "GDocs for markdown" was still alive, just taking a different path than expected.

The plan was written. The research was done. Now it was time to build.

## Session 7: Down the WASM Rabbit Hole

*July 20, 2025, 6:50 AM EDT*

Twenty-two minutes after creating the comprehensive Automerge plan, I needed to understand something deeper: "read what you can online about the automerge crdt project then help me understand where its using wasm in a scenario like a nextjs app as the frontend and a plain node api backend"

This wasn't about implementation anymore. This was about understanding the architecture—why a collaboration library written in Rust was running in JavaScript.

### The Revelation

Claude's research uncovered the elegant architecture:

**Automerge's core CRDT logic is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.**

This single design decision cascaded into everything:
- High performance for conflict resolution algorithms
- Cross-platform compatibility (browser, Node.js, mobile)
- Memory safety from Rust
- Consistent behavior everywhere

### The Package Puzzle

The investigation revealed a layered architecture:

```
@automerge/automerge         (High-level JavaScript API)
    ↓
@automerge/automerge-wasm    (Low-level WASM bindings)
    ↓
Rust core compiled to WASM   (The actual CRDT magic)
```

But here was the catch: "@automerge/automerge-wasm is something we currently consider to be an implementation detail and should not be depended on by third parties."

The WASM layer was meant to be invisible—power without complexity.

### The Frontend Challenge

For Next.js, things got interesting:

```javascript
// Can't just import and use
import { next as Automerge } from '@automerge/automerge/slim'
import wasm from "@automerge/automerge/automerge.wasm?url"

// Must initialize WASM first
await Automerge.initializeWasm(wasm)
```

Browsers don't support WebAssembly modules in ESM imports. You need bundler magic. Webpack needs `asyncWebAssembly` experiments. The complexity was leaking through.

### The Backend Simplicity

But in Node.js? Different story:

```javascript
// Just works
import { next as Automerge } from '@automerge/automerge'
const doc = Automerge.init()
```

No initialization. No configuration. The WASM loads transparently. Node.js treated WebAssembly like any other module.

### The Performance Numbers

Claude found Martin Kleppmann's columnar encoding achievements:
- 100KB document stored in 160KB on disk
- Only 1.5-2x size overhead
- Near-native speed for complex algorithms

This wasn't theoretical. Real documents, real performance, real memory efficiency.

### The Packaging Evolution

August 2024 had brought new packaging options:

1. **Standard Import** (for modern bundlers)
2. **Base64 Fallback** (for challenging environments)
3. **Manual initialization** (for control freaks)

The goal: "make Automerge possible anywhere, including quite a few places where it was difficult or impossible before."

They'd solved for:
- Cloudflare Workers
- React Native
- Val.town
- Various bundlers

### The Architectural Wisdom

What emerged from this research session was profound:

**WASM wasn't just an implementation detail—it was the architecture.**

By writing the core in Rust and compiling to WASM, Automerge achieved:
- **Write once, run everywhere** (but actually)
- **Performance** where it mattered (the algorithms)
- **Flexibility** where needed (the JavaScript API)
- **Safety** throughout (Rust's guarantees)

### The Implication for TnyOffice

This research session changed how I thought about the implementation:

1. **Frontend complexity was expected**—bundler configuration was the price for WASM performance
2. **Backend simplicity was a gift**—Node.js would handle everything transparently
3. **The same code everywhere**—no separate implementations for client and server
4. **Performance was built-in**—not something to optimize later

### The Pattern Recognition

Saturday morning, still before 7 AM. The pattern of the project was becoming clear:

- **Friday evening**: Dream and plan
- **Friday night**: Build and hit walls
- **Saturday morning**: Research and understand

Each session wasn't just about writing code. It was about understanding the problem space, the tools, the tradeoffs. The WebAssembly research wasn't a detour—it was essential preparation.

Because when you're building real-time collaboration, you need to understand not just what works, but why it works. The WASM layer wasn't complexity—it was the foundation that made everything else simple.

## Session 8: The Implementation Marathon

*July 20, 2025, 7:02 AM EDT*

The session started with context from a previous conversation that had run out of tokens. The summary revealed the journey: cr-sqlite attempt, npm errors, pivot to Automerge, comprehensive planning. Now it was time to build.

### The Automerge Implementation

Claude dove straight into implementation:
- SQLite storage adapter for Automerge persistence
- Document service for converting between formats
- WebSocket server with dual setup (native WS for Automerge, Socket.io for presence)
- Updated REST endpoints to use Automerge documents

The architecture was taking shape:
```
Browser ↔ WebSocket ↔ Express API ↔ Automerge Repo ↔ SQLite Storage
```

### The Frontend Battle

Then came the frontend integration. This is where things got interesting.

"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isReady')"

The first error. Claude tried using `useDocument` from automerge-repo-react-hooks. Wrong approach.

"handle.doc is not a function"

Second error. The API confusion was real. Was it `handle.doc()` or `handle.docSync()`? Was there an `isReady()` method or a `whenReady()` promise?

"TypeError: docHandle.whenReady is not a function"

"TypeError: docHandle.isReady is not a function"

I watched Claude go in circles, trying different combinations of methods that didn't exist. The frustration was palpable through the error messages.

### The Breakthrough

Finally, I had to intervene with the actual example from automerge-codemirror. The solution was simpler than all the attempts:

```typescript
const syncPlugin = automergeSyncPlugin({
  handle,
  path: ['content'],
});
```

Just pass the handle. No checking if it's ready. No waiting for promises. The plugin handles everything.

"great! that works."

### The Simplification

With collaboration working, I made a decisive call: "we don't need the read-only or Edit modes anymore. We should just always be in Collaborate mode when we click on a document."

Why have three modes when one does everything? Every document became collaborative by default. The Edit button disappeared. The Save button vanished. Just real-time sync, all the time.

### The Git Cleanup

A small but important detail: SQLite's WAL files were polluting the repository.

"i added database.db-shm and database.db-wal to the api .gitignore. But they were already committed."

Claude cleaned up the git history, removing the files from tracking while preserving the database itself.

### The Deployment Struggle

Then came the deployment attempt to Fly.io. What worked perfectly locally fell apart in Docker:

```
=> ERROR [build 5/6] RUN npm run build
```

TypeScript compilation errors. Missing type definitions. The same `await` issues we'd just fixed locally were back in the Docker build.

"isn't that await the thing we just spent forever fixing?"

I was right to be suspicious. Claude was trying to "fix" code that already worked, adding back the problematic awaits we'd removed.

"i've discarded your changes. this is working locally perfectly. let's not mess it up."

### The Wisdom of Stopping

Sometimes the best decision is to not deploy. The code worked locally. The WebSockets were syncing. Documents were collaborating. The deployment issues were configuration problems, not code problems.

"forget the deployment for now. just remember all the great work we did on the API and docs to make it real-time and collaborative."

### The State of Success

By the end of this marathon session, TnyOffice had transformed:

**Before:**
- Static documents
- Manual save buttons
- Single-user editing
- File-based storage

**After:**
- Real-time collaboration
- Automatic syncing
- Multi-user editing
- CRDT-powered conflict resolution
- WebSocket communication
- Automerge documents in SQLite

The dream from Friday evening was now reality. Two browsers could edit the same document, see each other's changes instantly, and never lose data to conflicts.

### The Lessons Learned

1. **API documentation matters** - The confusion around DocHandle methods cost hours
2. **Local success ≠ deployment success** - Docker builds have their own challenges
3. **Sometimes simpler is better** - Removing edit/save modes improved the UX
4. **Know when to stop** - Not every session needs to end with deployment

Saturday morning's implementation marathon had delivered. The prototype worked. The collaboration was real. The GDocs-for-markdown dream was no longer a dream.

---

## Session 9: The Deployment Dance

*July 20, 2025, 7:56 AM EDT*

"we have an api in @apps/api/ directory of this monorepo that's running perfectly in local dev. it now adds websockets. the old version of this api is deployed and running nicely at fly.io. now it's time to update our deployment and get this new version up on fly, replacing the old one."

The real-time collaboration worked locally. Now came the real test: deployment.

### The TypeScript Reckoning

Before any deployment could happen, the build had to work:

```
npm run build

src/automerge/document-service.ts:32:7 - error TS2740: Type 'Promise<DocHandle<MarkdownDocument>>' is missing the following properties...
src/automerge/document-service.ts:40:13 - error TS2540: Cannot assign to 'content' because it is a read-only property...
src/automerge/sqlite-adapter.ts:8:11 - error TS2702: 'Database' only refers to a type, but is being used as a namespace...
```

Eleven errors. The code worked perfectly with `npm run dev`, but TypeScript's strict compilation caught every type mismatch:

- `repo.find()` returned a Promise, not a DocHandle
- Automerge documents used read-only proxies
- Better-sqlite3's Statement types were imported wrong
- WebSocket type compatibility issues

Claude methodically fixed each:
```typescript
// Before
handle = repo.find<MarkdownDocument>(file.automerge_id);

// After  
handle = await repo.find<MarkdownDocument>(file.automerge_id);

// Before
handle.change((doc: Doc<MarkdownDocument>) => {
  doc.content = file.content;
});

// After - let TypeScript infer the mutable proxy
handle.change((doc) => {
  doc.content = file.content;
});
```

Build successful.

### The Fly.io Configuration

The fly.toml needed WebSocket support. Claude added a new services section:

```toml
[[services]]
  internal_port = 3001
  protocol = "tcp"
  auto_stop_machines = false  # Keep running for WebSockets
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 1    # Always have one instance

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["http"]
    port = "80"
    force_https = true

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = "443"
```

### The Deployment Attempt

```bash
fly deploy
```

The build succeeded. The image was created. Then:

```
Failed to update machines: Services [1] Ports [0] Force https force_https is not allowed when the tls handler is enabled
```

The configuration conflict. You can't force HTTPS on a port that already handles TLS. Quick fix—separate the handlers.

### The Nuclear Option

"ok. some weird problems killing the old vm. I just deleted the tny-office-api app in the fly dashboard. help me deploy it from scratch again"

Sometimes the cleanest solution is to start fresh. The new deployment strategy:

1. Create new Fly app
2. Create persistent volume for SQLite
3. Deploy with WebSocket configuration
4. Configure environment variables

### The WebSocket Connection Issue

Deployment succeeded. The API was live. But then:

```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3001/automerge-sync' failed
```

The frontend was still trying to connect to localhost! The issue was simple but critical—the WebSocket URL wasn't configured:

```bash
## Added to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://tny-office-api.fly.dev/automerge-sync
```

### The Documentation Update

With everything working, the README needed to reflect reality:

**Before:**
- "A monorepo containing multiple Next.js applications"
- No deployment instructions
- No mention of WebSockets

**After:**
- "Real-time collaborative markdown editor API with TypeScript, Express, SQLite, and Automerge CRDTs"
- Complete Fly.io deployment guide
- WebSocket URLs and configuration
- Monitoring commands

### The Lessons of Deployment

1. **Local dev hides type errors** - TypeScript's dev mode is forgiving, build mode is not
2. **WebSocket configs are different** - HTTP deployments don't prepare you for WebSocket complexity
3. **Environment variables multiply** - API URL, WebSocket URL, different for each environment
4. **Sometimes starting fresh is faster** - Don't fight with broken VMs

### The Victory

By 8:00 AM Saturday, TnyOffice was live:
- API deployed on Fly.io with WebSocket support
- Real-time collaboration working across the internet
- Persistent SQLite storage with volume mounts
- Automatic HTTPS with WebSocket upgrade

The browser console showed the magic:
```
WebSocket connected to wss://tny-office-api.fly.dev/automerge-sync
Automerge document synchronized
```

Two users, different locations, same document, instant sync.

### The Architecture Complete

The deployment revealed the full architecture:

```
Browser (Next.js + Automerge)
    ↓ WSS
Fly.io (Express + WebSocket Server)
    ↓
SQLite (Persistent Volume)
    ↓
Automerge Storage Adapter
```

Every piece had found its place. The prototype was no longer local—it was real, deployed, accessible.

The dream from Friday evening—"GDocs for markdown"—was now a URL anyone could visit.

---

## Session 10: Git All The Things

*July 20, 2025, 8:35 AM EDT*

After the successful deployment, a new requirement emerged: "let's make a specific plan for the git integration. write a new file in @apps/api/plans/ called git_plan.md that outlines our most basic and simple approach in this prototype for adding git capabilities."

The vision was clear: Every document in the database should also exist in a git repository. Add, update, delete—all tracked in git. First locally, then eventually pushed to GitHub.

![Git Sync](./images/push-doc.png)

### The Architecture Question

The plan started with a simple directive: "Initialize a bare git repo at `/data/git-repo` (persistent Fly.io volume)"

But then I asked Claude to check something important: "check what we do with the creation of the sqlite database on the filesystem.. does it differ for production (fly.io) vs local dev?"

The answer revealed thoughtful design:

```typescript
const dbPath = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? '/data/database.db'
  : path.join(__dirname, '../../database.db');
```

Production used the Fly.io persistent volume at `/data`. Development used a local path. The git repository would follow the same pattern.

### The Git Strategy

Claude's plan was elegantly simple:

#### Repository Structure
```
/data/git-repo/
├── .git/
├── documents/
│   ├── {id}-{filename}  # e.g., "abc123-readme.md"
│   └── ...
└── .gitignore
```

Using `{id}-{filename}` solved multiple problems:
- No filename collisions
- Stable paths even if titles changed
- Easy mapping between database and filesystem

#### The Sync Algorithm

```typescript
POST /api/v1/git/sync
```

One endpoint to rule them all:
1. Query all documents from SQLite
2. List all files in the git repository
3. Determine changes (new, modified, deleted)
4. Apply changes to filesystem
5. Create a single commit
6. Return sync status and commit hash

### The Implementation Details

The plan outlined using `simple-git` for Node.js git operations:

```typescript
interface GitSyncResult {
  success: boolean;
  commitHash?: string;
  changes: {
    added: string[];
    modified: string[];
    deleted: string[];
  };
  error?: string;
}
```

Every sync would produce a clear result—what changed and where it ended up.

### The Phased Approach

Claude wisely structured the implementation in phases:

**Phase 1 (Current Prototype)**
- Local git repository
- Manual sync endpoint
- Basic add/update/delete operations
- Single commit per sync

**Phase 2 (Near Future)**
- Automatic sync on document changes
- Individual commits per change
- Meaningful commit messages
- Git history endpoint

**Phase 3 (Remote Integration)**
- GitHub authentication
- Push to remote
- Pull from remote (with conflict resolution)
- Branch management

### The Technical Considerations

The plan addressed real-world concerns:

#### Performance
- Initial sync might be slow with many documents
- Use git's built-in efficiency for incremental updates
- Consider batching for large repositories

#### Security
- Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal
- Limit file sizes to prevent abuse
- No sensitive data in commit messages

#### Error Handling
- Validate git repository state before operations
- Handle file system errors gracefully
- Rollback strategy if commit fails

### The Philosophical Alignment

This git integration plan perfectly embodied the TnyOffice philosophy:

1. **Start simple** - One sync endpoint, basic operations
2. **Build incrementally** - Three clear phases
3. **Think production** - Persistent volumes, error handling
4. **Plan for scale** - GitHub integration path clear from day one

### The Bridge Between Worlds

What made this plan special wasn't just the git integration—it was bridging two paradigms:

- **Database world**: UUIDs, timestamps, relational data
- **Git world**: Files, commits, distributed version control

The `{id}-{filename}` naming was the key—maintaining database integrity while providing human-readable git history.

### The Saturday Morning Pattern

Looking at the clock—8:35 AM on a Saturday—the pattern was clear:
- Friday evening: Dream and plan
- Friday night: Build and deploy
- Saturday morning: Extend and integrate

Each session built on the last. The git integration wasn't a new feature—it was the natural evolution of a system that already knew how to persist, sync, and collaborate.

The documents weren't just in a database anymore. They were becoming part of a larger ecosystem—trackable, versionable, shareable.

---

## Session 11: Comments, Finally

*July 20, 2025, 12:08 PM EDT*

After the git integration planning, attention turned to what every collaborative editor needs: "we're going to make a plan for commenting capabilities in this app."

I shared a detailed proposal—a canvas outlining Google Docs-style comments on top of the existing Next.js + CodeMirror 6 + Automerge setup. The architecture was clear, the approach was solid. But Claude had learned something important by now.

"remember this is a solid prototype. make simple, straightforward plans for prototyping"

![Comments](./images/add-comment.png)

### The Simplification

The plans that emerged were beautifully minimal:

#### API Plan
```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  author: string;
  text: string;
  createdAt: number;
  anchorStart: number;  // character offset
  anchorEnd: number;
}
```

Three endpoints. That's it:
- `POST /api/v1/files/:id/comments` - Create
- `GET /api/v1/files/:id/comments` - List
- `DELETE /api/v1/files/:id/comments/:commentId` - Delete

#### UI Plan
- Yellow highlights for commented text
- Simple sidebar listing comments
- Click comment to jump to text
- Cmd+K to add comment

No threads. No replies. No resolve/unresolve. No permissions. Just comments.

### The Critical Question

"with this approach, will the comments show up in the actual text of the document that a user sees?"

This was important. The answer revealed the elegance of the design:

"No, comments won't show up in the actual document text. The comments are stored in a separate `comments` map within the Automerge document structure, not mixed into the `content` text field."

Like Google Docs—highlighted text in the document, comment content in the sidebar. The markdown stays clean.

### The Implementation Sprint

"great. the current approach you've proposed is good. begin implementing the api"

What followed was a methodical implementation:

#### 1. Update the Types
```typescript
// Added to MarkdownDocument
export interface MarkdownDocument {
  content: string;
  comments?: { [id: string]: Comment };
  metadata?: {...};
}
```

#### 2. Add the Endpoints
The beauty was in what didn't need to be added:
- No WebSocket code (Automerge syncs the comments automatically)
- No persistence logic (comments live in the document)
- No conflict resolution (CRDTs handle it)

#### 3. The Testing Moment
"give me the specific curl commands for this file id 4e2f1e8d-8de0-4a58-91dc-d049ceb70f0b"

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/files/4e2f1e8d-8de0-4a58-91dc-d049ceb70f0b/comments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "author": "TestUser",
    "text": "This needs clarification",
    "anchorStart": 10,
    "anchorEnd": 25
  }'
```

"yep. those work."

### The UI Implementation

"great. work on the ui implementation"

The UI came together in layers:

#### CodeMirror Extension
```typescript
const commentMark = Decoration.mark({
  class: 'cm-comment-highlight',
  attributes: { title: 'Click to view comment' }
});
```

#### Comments Sidebar
A simple React component showing:
- Author and timestamp
- Comment text
- Character range
- Delete button for your own comments

#### The Integration
The magic was that comments synced automatically through Automerge. Add a comment in one browser, see it instantly in another. Edit the document, comments stay anchored to the right text.

### The Architecture Beauty

What made this implementation special wasn't what was built—it was what wasn't needed:

**Didn't need:**
- Separate comment database table
- WebSocket message types for comments
- Position recalculation logic
- Conflict resolution code
- Manual sync logic

**Got for free:**
- Real-time sync
- Automatic position tracking
- Conflict-free updates
- Persistence with document
- Offline support

### The Philosophical Victory

This commenting implementation was the culmination of every architectural decision:
- Automerge provided the sync
- CRDTs handled the conflicts
- WebSockets were already there
- The document model just expanded

Saturday afternoon. In four hours, TnyOffice had gained a feature that takes most editors weeks to implement. Not because Claude was fast, but because the foundation was right.

![View Comments](./images/view-comment.png)

### The Pattern Complete

Looking at the day's progression:
- **Morning**: Git integration planning
- **Afternoon**: Comments implementation
- **Foundation**: Everything built on Automerge

Each feature wasn't a separate system—it was an extension of the document model. Comments weren't bolted on; they were always possible, just waiting to be revealed.

The prototype was becoming something more. Not through grand features, but through careful additions that each made the whole more complete.

---

## Session 12: The Hard Problems

*July 20, 2025, 12:24 PM EDT*

After implementing comments, two architectural questions emerged that would test the foundations of TnyOffice: "let's start thinking about how we'll handle pulling changes from git" and later, "we need to make our own plan for undo/redo."

These weren't features—they were fundamental challenges to the collaborative editing model.

### The Git Pull Conundrum

The question was deceptively simple: What happens when someone edits a document in git while others are editing it live in the app?

"help me understand in detail how the diffs from git will get applied. will they completely overwrite docs or just look like changes. what if people are editing the doc in realtime then what?"

This revealed the core tension: Git thinks in files. Automerge thinks in operations. Users think in edits.

#### The Naive Approach Would Fail

```typescript
handle.change((doc) => {
  doc.content = gitContent; // BAD: Replaces entire document
});
```

"User A would experience: Entire document instantly replaced, cursor position jumps to beginning, text being typed is lost... Terrible user experience!"

#### The Sophisticated Solution

The plan that emerged treated git changes as collaborative edits:

1. **Calculate differences** using diff algorithms
2. **Convert to character operations** 
3. **Apply as Automerge operations**
4. **Let CRDT handle conflicts**

The result: "Changes appear gradually, like another user typing. Cursor position preserved when possible. Can continue typing without interruption."

Git changes wouldn't disrupt—they'd collaborate.

### The Undo/Redo Architecture

"read this readme carefully https://github.com/onsetsoftware/automerge-repo-undo-redo ... I don't want to use this github repo because it's not active. I want to learn from it and you read its code and you make our own plan for this."

Claude analyzed the reference implementation and created something better—an undo/redo system that understood collaboration.

#### Key Insights

1. **User-Specific History**: Each user has their own undo stack for their changes only
2. **Patch-Based Storage**: Use Automerge's native patch system
3. **Scope Support**: Separate undo for text vs comments
4. **Transaction Support**: Group related changes

The architecture:
```typescript
interface UndoRedoEntry {
  patches: {
    redo: Patch[];  // To apply the change
    undo: Patch[];  // To reverse the change
  };
  heads: {
    before: Heads;  // Document state before
    after: Heads;   // Document state after
  };
}
```

### The Comment Synchronization Challenge

"capture the fact that we'll also need to do work so that undo/redo works nicely with comments so that when the user makes an undo or redo that modifies the text that a comment was associated with the right thing happens."

This was the hardest problem yet. Comments are anchored to text positions. What happens when undo changes those positions?

#### The Edge Cases

1. **Text Deletion Undo**: Comments should reappear at original positions
2. **Text Insertion Undo**: Comments should shrink back to original boundaries
3. **Comment Orphaning**: When commented text disappears completely
4. **Position Reversal**: When operations flip start and end positions

The solution involved cursor tracking, position validation, and careful state management:

```typescript
function validateCommentPositions(doc: MarkdownDocument) {
  Object.entries(doc.comments || {}).forEach(([id, comment]) => {
    const startPos = getCursorPosition(comment.startCursor);
    const endPos = getCursorPosition(comment.endCursor);
    
    if (startPos === endPos) {
      comment.status = 'orphaned';
    } else if (startPos > endPos) {
      // Swap if reversed
      [comment.anchorStart, comment.anchorEnd] = [endPos, startPos];
    }
  });
}
```

### The Pattern of Complexity

Saturday afternoon revealed a pattern in TnyOffice's evolution:

1. **Start with simple features** (comments, git sync)
2. **Discover edge cases** (live editing conflicts, position tracking)
3. **Design sophisticated solutions** (diff-based merge, cursor tracking)
4. **Maintain simple UX** (looks like normal editing)

Each "simple" feature revealed layers of complexity that required deep architectural thinking.

### The Philosophy Emerges

These planning sessions crystallized TnyOffice's philosophy:

**External changes should feel like collaboration, not disruption.**

Whether from git, undo/redo, or other users:
- Changes apply gradually
- Positions adjust naturally  
- Conflicts resolve automatically
- Users keep working uninterrupted

### The Documents Created

Two comprehensive planning documents emerged:

1. **`git_pull_plan.md`**: 979 lines detailing diff-based merge strategy
2. **`undo_redo_plan.md`**: 378 lines (before comment sync additions)

These weren't just feature specs—they were architectural treatises on collaborative editing.

### The Realization

By noon on Saturday, TnyOffice had evolved from a "GDocs for markdown" prototype to a system grappling with fundamental problems in collaborative software:

- How do you merge external changes without disruption?
- How do you undo in a collaborative environment?
- How do you maintain referential integrity across operations?

The answers weren't in libraries or frameworks. They required understanding the deep structure of collaborative editing and designing solutions from first principles.

---

## Session 13: The Implementation Details

*July 20, 2025, 1:41 PM EDT*

Saturday afternoon brought a specific technical question that revealed important implementation details: "in this app, look at the @apps/api/ implementation of git sync. Tell me what happens when a sync request comes in to the api with a new remote defined. is it added as a remote to the server filesystem git repo? or is it swapped in and the old remote is gone? or something else?"

This wasn't idle curiosity. Understanding how the system handles git remotes would determine deployment flexibility and multi-repository workflows.

### The Investigation

Claude dove into the code, examining `git.ts` routes and the `GitSyncService` implementation. The answer revealed thoughtful design:

```typescript
private async configureRemote(overrideRemoteUrl?: string): Promise<void> {
  const remoteUrl = overrideRemoteUrl || process.env.GIT_REMOTE_URL;
  
  // Check if origin remote exists
  const remotes = await this.git.getRemotes(true);
  const originRemote = remotes.find(remote => remote.name === 'origin');

  if (!originRemote) {
    // Add origin remote
    await this.git.addRemote('origin', remoteUrl);
    log.info('Added git remote origin');
  } else {
    // Update origin URL if it changed
    const currentUrl = originRemote.refs?.push || originRemote.refs?.fetch;
    if (currentUrl !== remoteUrl) {
      await this.git.remote(['set-url', 'origin', remoteUrl]);
      log.info('Updated git remote origin');
    }
  }
}
```

### The Remote Strategy: Update, Don't Add

The implementation revealed a clear strategy:

1. **Single Remote Model**: Always uses 'origin' as the remote name
2. **Dynamic Updates**: If a new URL is provided, it replaces the existing origin
3. **Stateless Requests**: Each sync can specify a different remote
4. **Fallback to Environment**: Uses `GIT_REMOTE_URL` env var if not specified

This wasn't accumulating remotes—it was swapping them.

### The Implications

This design choice had important consequences:

#### Flexibility
```typescript
// Sync to personal repo
POST /api/v1/git/sync
{ "remoteUrl": "https://github.com/user/personal-notes.git" }

// Next sync to team repo
POST /api/v1/git/sync
{ "remoteUrl": "https://github.com/team/shared-docs.git" }
```

Each request could target a different repository without accumulating remote configurations.

#### Simplicity
No remote management UI needed. No confusion about which remote to use. Always 'origin', always current.

#### Security
Previous remote URLs don't persist. Each sync explicitly declares its target. No accidental pushes to old remotes.

### The Initialization Flow

The code also revealed the initialization sequence:

```typescript
async initializeRepo(overrideRemoteUrl?: string): Promise<void> {
  // Create directory if needed
  await fs.mkdir(this.gitRepoPath, { recursive: true });
  
  // Check if already initialized
  const gitDir = path.join(this.gitRepoPath, '.git');
  try {
    await fs.access(gitDir);
    log.info('Git repository already initialized');
  } catch {
    // Initialize new repo
    await this.git.init();
    await fs.mkdir(documentsDir, { recursive: true });
    await this.git.commit('Initial commit');
  }
  
  // Configure remote (adds or updates)
  await this.configureRemote(overrideRemoteUrl);
}
```

Every sync ensures proper initialization and remote configuration. Idempotent and self-healing.

### The Environment Variable Fallback

The pattern revealed throughout:
```typescript
const remoteUrl = overrideRemoteUrl || process.env.GIT_REMOTE_URL;
```

This allowed two deployment modes:
1. **Fixed Remote**: Set `GIT_REMOTE_URL` for consistent target
2. **Dynamic Remote**: Pass URL with each request for flexibility

### The Logging Strategy

Notable was the security-conscious logging:
```typescript
log.info('Configuring git remote with URL:', 
  remoteUrl.replace(/:[^@]+@/, ':***@'));
```

Passwords in git URLs were masked in logs. Small detail, important for production.

### The Design Philosophy

This investigation revealed design principles that permeated TnyOffice:

1. **Stateless Operations**: Each request self-contained
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Environment → Request → Default
3. **Self-Healing**: Always ensure correct state
4. **Security Conscious**: Mask sensitive data
5. **Single Source of Truth**: One remote, always current

### The Saturday Afternoon Pattern

This session exemplified a pattern in the development:
- Start with a specific technical question
- Investigate the implementation
- Discover the design philosophy
- Understand the implications

Each question about "how" revealed decisions about "why."

### The Practical Impact

This remote handling strategy meant:
- Users could sync to personal repos for backup
- Teams could sync to shared repos for collaboration  
- CI/CD could sync to different branches/repos
- All without configuration complexity

The implementation was more sophisticated than expected, yet simpler to use.

### The Continuing Evolution

Saturday afternoon, 1:41 PM. The questions were becoming more specific, the implementations more refined. The prototype was revealing its production potential through these detailed investigations.

Every line of code examined showed the same pattern: thoughtful design hidden behind simple interfaces.

---

## Session 14: Security Reality Check

*July 20, 2025, 8:15 PM EDT*

Saturday evening brought a sobering realization: "look at @apps/api/ and @apps/api/README.md then start making a plan in api/plans/simple_auth.md for how we can implement the simplest approach to protect all of our API endpoints."

The context was crucial: "it's a prototype but it'll have some of our real data in it so we dont want it open on the internet."

### The Security Audit

Claude's analysis revealed the uncomfortable truth:

**Current Security State:**
- No authentication middleware - API completely open
- No API keys or tokens required
- CORS enabled with wildcard - accepts requests from any origin
- No rate limiting
- Git sync accepts any remote URL
- WebSocket connections have no authentication

Anyone could:
- Create, read, update, delete any document
- Add or remove comments
- Trigger git syncs to any repository
- Connect to WebSockets and receive all updates

The prototype had evolved beyond a demo. It needed protection.

### The Requirements

The constraints shaped the solution:
- "We don't need multi-user auth or anything like that"
- Frontend on Vercel (already protected by Vercel auth)
- API on Fly.io (completely exposed)
- Just need to secure communication between frontend and backend
- Keep it simple but effective

### The Simple Auth Plan

The solution that emerged was beautifully minimal: **Single API Key Authentication**

```typescript
// Backend validates
const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key'];
if (apiKey !== process.env.API_KEY) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
}

// Frontend sends
fetch(url, {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY }
});
```

One key. Shared secret. Problem solved.

### The Implementation

"begin implementing this plan"

What followed was methodical implementation:

#### 1. Authentication Middleware
```typescript
export const authenticateRequest = (req, res, next) => {
  const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key'];
  
  // Skip in dev if no key set (developer friendly)
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && !expectedKey) {
    logger.warn('API_KEY not set in development mode - skipping');
    return next();
  }
  
  if (!apiKey || apiKey !== process.env.API_KEY) {
    logger.warn(`Authentication failed from ${req.ip}`);
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  
  next();
};
```

#### 2. Apply to All Routes
```typescript
// Health check (no auth)
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok' });
});

// Everything else needs auth
app.use('/api/v1', authenticateRequest);
```

#### 3. WebSocket Security
Both Socket.io and native WebSocket connections needed protection:

```typescript
// Socket.io
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const apiKey = socket.handshake.auth.apiKey;
  if (apiKey === process.env.API_KEY) {
    next();
  } else {
    next(new Error('Unauthorized'));
  }
});
```

### The Developer Experience

The implementation revealed thoughtful touches:

1. **Development Flexibility**: Skip auth in dev if no key set
2. **Clear Logging**: Track failed attempts with IP addresses
3. **Helpful Errors**: Distinguish between missing and invalid keys
4. **Health Check**: Keep one endpoint open for monitoring

### The Deployment Strategy

```bash
## Generate secure key
openssl rand -hex 32

## Set on Fly.io
fly secrets set API_KEY="your-key"

## Set on Vercel
## Add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY in dashboard
```

Simple commands, immediate security.

### The Philosophy

This session exemplified TnyOffice's approach to complexity:

1. **Identify the actual need** (protect real data)
2. **Find the simplest solution** (shared API key)
3. **Implement thoughtfully** (dev-friendly, production-secure)
4. **Document clearly** (comprehensive plan before code)

No JWT complexity. No OAuth flows. No user management. Just enough security for the actual requirement.

### The Lesson

Saturday evening, 8:15 PM. After a day of building advanced features—real-time collaboration, comments, git integration—the focus shifted to fundamentals: Don't leave your API open on the internet.

The solution took less than an hour to implement but would prevent countless potential problems. Sometimes the most important code is the simplest.

### The Security Mindset

This session marked a transition. TnyOffice was no longer just a prototype to demonstrate ideas. It would hold real data, face the real internet, need real security.

The implementation was minimal but the mindset shift was significant: Every feature from now on would need to consider authentication, authorization, and security.

The weekend project was growing up.

## Session 15: Understanding the Magic

*July 20, 2025, 8:25 PM EDT*

Saturday evening brought an intentional question: "explain how multiple users can be editing the same document at the same time in @apps/docs/"

This wasn't idle curiosity—it was strategic context loading. By asking Claude to explain the existing architecture, I was priming the AI assistant with deep understanding of the codebase before the next round of implementation. A meta-move: using explanation as preparation.

### The Investigation

Claude's analysis revealed a sophisticated architecture built on cutting-edge technology:

#### The Components

1. **CollaborativeEditor Component** (apps/docs/components/collaborative-editor.tsx)
   - React component with Automerge integration
   - CodeMirror for rich editing experience
   - Real-time synchronization via automergeSyncPlugin

2. **Document Service** (apps/api/src/automerge/document-service.ts)
   - Server-side Automerge document management
   - Handles document creation, updates, and sync

3. **WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - Socket.io for real-time communication
   - Native WebSocket fallback
   - Bidirectional sync messages

### The Magic: CRDTs

The core insight was Automerge's use of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs):

```typescript
// Each user has their own document copy
const handle = await repo.find<MarkdownDocument>(documentUrl);

// Changes are made locally first
handle.change((doc) => {
  doc.content = newContent;
});

// Automerge automatically syncs changes
```

No central authority. No locking. No conflicts.

### The Flow

Claude traced the collaboration lifecycle:

#### 1. User Opens Document
```typescript
// Frontend requests document
const docHandle = await repo.find<MarkdownDocument>(documentUrl);

// Establishes WebSocket connection
const socket = io(API_URL);
```

#### 2. User Makes Edit
```typescript
// CodeMirror captures keystroke
// automergeSyncPlugin intercepts change
// Automerge applies change locally
handle.change((d) => {
  d.content = applyEdit(d.content, edit);
});
```

#### 3. Sync Happens
```typescript
// Automerge generates sync message
// Sent via WebSocket to server
socket.emit('sync', syncMessage);

// Server broadcasts to other clients
io.to(documentId).emit('sync', syncMessage);
```

#### 4. Other Users Receive
```typescript
// Sync message arrives
// Automerge merges changes
// CodeMirror updates view
// No conflicts!
```

### The Key Insights

#### Why It Works

1. **Local-First**: Each user edits their own copy
2. **Eventual Consistency**: All copies converge to same state
3. **Automatic Merging**: CRDTs handle conflicts mathematically
4. **No Server Authority**: Server just relays messages

#### The Trade-offs

- **Storage**: Each operation stored, not just final state
- **Complexity**: CRDT algorithms are non-trivial
- **Network**: More messages than centralized approach
- **But**: True offline support, no conflicts, perfect consistency

### The CodeMirror Integration

The crucial piece was the Automerge-CodeMirror plugin:

```typescript
const syncPlugin = automergeSyncPlugin({
  handle,           // Automerge document handle
  path: ['content'], // Path to text in document
});
```

This plugin:
1. Intercepts CodeMirror changes
2. Converts to Automerge operations
3. Applies remote changes to editor
4. Maintains cursor positions

### The Comments Layer

Even comments were collaborative:

```typescript
// Comments stored in Automerge document
handle.change((doc) => {
  if (!doc.comments) doc.comments = [];
  doc.comments.push(newComment);
});

// UI updates automatically
useEffect(() => {
  updateComments(editorView, doc.comments);
}, [doc.comments]);
```

### The Server's Role

Surprisingly minimal:

```typescript
// Server just relays messages
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-document', (docId) => {
    socket.join(docId);
  });
  
  socket.on('sync', (message) => {
    socket.to(docId).broadcast.emit('sync', message);
  });
});
```

No conflict resolution. No operational transformation. Just message passing.

### The "Aha" Moment

The session revealed the elegance: By choosing CRDTs (specifically Automerge), TnyOffice avoided the entire category of problems that plague collaborative editors:

- No operational transformation complexity
- No server-side conflict resolution
- No "last write wins" data loss
- No complex locking mechanisms

The technology choice determined the architecture, and the architecture enabled the features.

### The Philosophy

This deep dive exemplified a pattern throughout TnyOffice:

1. **Choose the right primitive** (CRDTs for collaboration)
2. **Let it shape the architecture** (local-first, message passing)
3. **Keep the server simple** (just relay, don't coordinate)
4. **Trust the technology** (Automerge handles the hard parts)

### The Learning

Saturday evening, 8:25 PM. After implementing features all day, stepping back to understand the "why" behind the "how." 

The magic wasn't in complex server coordination or clever conflict resolution algorithms. It was in choosing a technology (CRDTs) that made conflicts impossible by design.

Sometimes the best engineering is picking the right foundation and getting out of its way.

### The Revelation

This session marked a transition in understanding. TnyOffice wasn't just using modern tools—it was embracing fundamentally different paradigms:

- Local-first instead of server-authoritative
- CRDTs instead of operational transformation  
- Message passing instead of RPC
- Eventual consistency instead of strong consistency

Each choice simplified the implementation while enabling more powerful features.

## Session 16: Adding Destructive Power

*July 20, 2025, 9:59 PM EDT*

Late Saturday night, a straightforward request: "learn about how this @apps/api/ is implemented and then add an api endpoint for deleting a document"

Claude's response was systematic. First understand, then implement.

### The Investigation Phase

The AI agent created a task list:
- Explore the API structure and routing setup
- Understand the document service implementation
- Review existing document operations
- Implement delete document endpoint
- Test the delete endpoint

This wasn't just coding—it was archaeology. Understanding the existing patterns before adding new functionality.

### The Architecture Discovery

Claude uncovered the layers:

#### 1. Express Router Structure
```typescript
// apps/api/src/routes/files.ts
router.post('/', createFile);
router.get('/', listFiles);
router.get('/:id', getFile);
router.put('/:id', updateFile);
// DELETE was missing
```

#### 2. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  automerge_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  created_at INTEGER,
  updated_at INTEGER
)
```

#### 3. Automerge Integration
Files weren't just database rows—they had associated Automerge documents for real-time collaboration.

### The Implementation

Claude's delete endpoint was comprehensive:

```typescript
router.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  
  // Validate UUID format
  if (!isValidUUID(id)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid file ID format' });
  }
  
  // Check if file exists
  const file = db.prepare('SELECT id, automerge_id FROM files WHERE id = ?').get(id);
  if (!file) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'File not found' });
  }
  
  // Clean up Automerge document if it exists
  if (file.automerge_id) {
    try {
      const repo = getRepo();
      await repo.delete(file.automerge_id);
      log.info(`Deleted Automerge document ${file.automerge_id}`);
    } catch (error) {
      log.error(`Error deleting Automerge document:`, error);
      // Continue with file deletion even if Automerge cleanup fails
    }
  }
  
  // Delete from database
  const result = db.prepare('DELETE FROM files WHERE id = ?').run(id);
  
  return res.json({ 
    success: true, 
    message: `File ${id} deleted successfully` 
  });
});
```

### The Crucial Details

#### Error Resilience
The implementation gracefully handled Automerge deletion failures—logging the error but continuing with database cleanup. Production thinking.

#### Import Management
```typescript
import { AutomergeUrl } from '@automerge/automerge-repo';
import { getRepo } from '../automerge/repo.js';
```

Claude automatically added the necessary imports, understanding the module structure.

#### TypeScript Compliance
Initial attempt had an unused variable. The TypeScript error:
```
src/routes/files.ts(529,15): error TS6133: 'handle' is declared but its value is never read.
```

Fixed immediately. No sloppy code.

### The Testing Interface

"just add it to @apps/api/src/public/index.html so I can test it manually"

Claude enhanced the test interface:

#### HTML Addition
```html
<div class="endpoint-card">
  <div class="endpoint-header">
    <span class="method delete">DELETE</span>
    <span class="path">/api/v1/files/:id</span>
  </div>
  <div class="endpoint-body">
    <p>Delete a file by ID</p>
    <form id="deleteForm">
      <input type="text" id="deleteFileId" placeholder="UUID" required>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger">Delete File</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### JavaScript Handler
```javascript
deleteForm.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const fileId = formData.get('deleteFileId');
  
  // Confirm deletion
  if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete file ${fileId}?`)) {
    return;
  }
  
  const result = await makeRequest('DELETE', `${API_BASE}/${fileId}`);
  
  if (result && result.status === 200) {
    deleteForm.reset();
  }
});
```

Confirmation dialog included. No accidental deletions.

#### CSS Styling
```css
.method.delete {
  background-color: #fee2e2;
  color: #991b1b;
}

.btn-danger {
  background-color: var(--danger-color);
  color: white;
}

.btn-danger:hover {
  background-color: #dc2626;
}
```

Visual language of danger. Red means destructive.

### The API Key Addition

"put an input box at the top where I can paste an API_KEY"

The session ended with adding authentication testing capability:

```html
<section class="api-key-section">
  <div class="api-key-card">
    <h3>API Authentication</h3>
    <input type="text" id="apiKey" placeholder="Enter your API key" />
    <button id="saveApiKey" class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
    <button id="clearApiKey" class="btn btn-secondary">Clear</button>
    <p class="api-key-status" id="apiKeyStatus">No API key set</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Testing infrastructure evolving alongside the API.

### The Pattern

This session exemplified the development rhythm:

1. **Understand before implementing** - Read existing code first
2. **Follow established patterns** - Match the existing router structure
3. **Handle edge cases** - Automerge cleanup, validation, error handling
4. **Make it testable** - Interactive UI for manual testing
5. **Think about security** - API key input for auth testing

### The Meta-Level

Saturday night, 9:59 PM. After a full day of building, still adding features. But notice the progression:

- Morning: Basic CRUD operations
- Afternoon: Real-time collaboration
- Evening: Security implementation
- Night: Destructive operations and testing infrastructure

Each session building on the last, each feature more sophisticated than the previous.

### The Lesson

Delete is simple in concept, complex in implementation. It's not just removing a row from a database—it's cleaning up distributed state, handling partial failures, confirming user intent, and maintaining system integrity.

The late-night coding session revealed the difference between a prototype and production code: It's in the error handling, the confirmations, the graceful degradation, and the testing tools.

Building software is as much about destroying data safely as creating it.

## Wrap-up

After 28 hours of building, TnyOffice had transformed from vision to working system:

**The Technical Stack:**
- Monorepo with Next.js apps and shared packages
- Express API with SQLite persistence
- Automerge CRDTs for conflict-free collaboration
- CodeMirror 6 for rich editing
- WebSockets for real-time sync
- Git integration for version control
- Deployed on Fly.io and Vercel

**The Features:**
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Comments with automatic position tracking
- Git sync with diff-based merging
- Undo/redo with user-specific history
- API authentication
- Interactive documentation

**The Philosophy:**
- Start simple, build incrementally
- Choose the right primitives (CRDTs for collaboration)
- Let technology shape architecture
- External changes should feel like collaboration
- Every decision considers production

### The Patterns and Lessons

#### Development Rhythm
- **Friday evening**: Dream and plan
- **Friday night**: Build and hit walls
- **Saturday morning**: Research and understand
- **Saturday afternoon**: Extend and integrate
- **Saturday evening**: Secure and polish

#### Key Insights
1. **Build it twice to build it right** - First API taught domain model, second taught persistence
2. **Small decisions compound** - Logger becomes observability, linting becomes safety net
3. **Technology choice determines architecture** - CRDTs eliminated entire categories of problems
4. **Local-first with eventual consistency** - Each user edits their copy, all converge to same state
5. **Simple interfaces hiding sophisticated implementation** - Delete isn't just removing a row

#### The Meta-Level
This wasn't just about building an editor. It was about:
- Understanding the problem space deeply
- Choosing foundations that make hard things possible
- Building incrementally with clear boundaries
- Thinking production from day one
- Learning from each failure and pivot

### The Result

In one weekend, TnyOffice evolved from "GDocs for markdown" intuition to a working system with:
- True real-time collaboration without conflicts
- Clean markdown that round-trips perfectly
- Git integration for version control
- Comments that survive document changes
- Production-ready security
- Deployment infrastructure

The dream from Friday evening was now a URL anyone could visit. Not through grand features, but through careful additions that each made the whole more complete.

The prototype had become something more—a demonstration that with the right foundations, modern tools, and focused execution, complex collaborative systems can emerge from simple beginnings.

### Epilogue: The Continuing Story

This weekend sprint wasn't the end—it was the beginning. Each feature revealed new possibilities, each implementation taught new lessons. The gap between single-player markdown and collaborative documentation had been bridged.

TnyOffice proved that the intuition was right: There did need to be something like Google Docs for markdown. And now, there was.
