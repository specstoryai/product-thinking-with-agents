# Product Thinking for Agentic Development
## From Human Teams to Agent Implementors

---

## Part 1: The Eternal Core of Product Management
### Drawing from Marty Cagan's Body of Work

### **The Product Operating Model Principles (Still True)**

#### 1. **Empowered Teams vs. Feature Teams**
- **Traditional**: Cross-functional teams (PM, Design, Engineering) empowered to solve problems, not just implement features
- **Core Principle**: Teams are given problems to solve, not solutions to build
- **Accountability**: Teams own outcomes (business results), not just outputs (features delivered)

#### 2. **The Four Critical Risks** 
Every product decision must address:
- **Value Risk**: Will customers buy it/choose to use it?
- **Usability Risk**: Can users figure out how to use it?
- **Feasibility Risk**: Can we build it with our skills and technology?
- **Viability Risk**: Does it work for our business (legal, sales, finance)?

#### 3. **Product Discovery vs. Delivery**
- **Discovery**: Rapid experimentation with prototypes to find solutions worth building
- **Delivery**: Building production-quality, scalable solutions
- **Key Insight**: "The best teams spend 80% less time in delivery because they get discovery right"

#### 4. **Core PM Competencies** (Cagan's Assessment Framework)
1. **Deep Customer Knowledge**: Understanding user problems, not just feature requests
2. **Deep Data Knowledge**: Using quantitative and qualitative insights
3. **Deep Business Knowledge**: Understanding constraints, economics, and stakeholders
4. **Deep Industry/Domain Knowledge**: Knowing the competitive landscape and trends

#### 5. **Strategic Context Over Roadmaps**
- Focus on outcomes and objectives (OKRs)
- Product strategy as "informed bets" based on insights
- Vision → Strategy → Team Objectives → Discovery

## Part 2: The Opportunity Assessment Framework
### Eternal Questions for Any Product Opportunity

### **Cagan's 10 Fundamental Questions (Adapted for Agentic Development)**

1. **What problem will this solve?** (Value Proposition)
   - Can you articulate it in one clear sentence?
   - Is this a vitamin or a painkiller?

2. **For whom do we solve that problem?** (Target Market)
   - Who experiences this problem most acutely?
   - Are they accessible and willing to change behavior?

3. **How big is the opportunity?** (Market Size)
   - TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
   - Growth potential and market dynamics

4. **What alternatives are out there?** (Competitive Landscape)
   - Direct competitors
   - Indirect solutions and workarounds
   - The "do nothing" alternative

5. **Why are we best suited to pursue this?** (Differentiator)
   - Unique capabilities or assets
   - Right to win in this space

6. **Why now?** (Market Window)
   - What has changed to make this possible/necessary?
   - Technology enablers, market shifts, regulatory changes

7. **How will we get this to market?** (Go-to-Market Strategy)
   - Distribution channels
   - Sales model implications
   - Customer acquisition approach

8. **How will we measure success?** (Success Metrics)
   - Leading and lagging indicators
   - North star metric

9. **What factors are critical to success?** (Key Dependencies)
   - Technical requirements
   - Partnerships needed
   - Critical assumptions to validate

10. **Given the above, should we pursue this opportunity?** (Go/No-Go Decision)
    - Risk-adjusted return
    - Opportunity cost consideration

### **Risk-Staged Investment Framework**

**Stage 1: Opportunity Discovery** (1-2 weeks)
- Validate the problem exists
- Confirm target market
- Size the opportunity
- Output: Opportunity Assessment Document

**Stage 2: Solution Discovery** (2-4 weeks)
- Prototype and test solutions
- Get evidence from real users
- Validate technical feasibility with agents
- Output: Evidence of product-market fit

**Stage 3: Build & Scale** (Ongoing)
- High-confidence development
- Iterative improvements based on usage
- Scaling go-to-market

## Part 3: What Changes with Agentic Development
### The New Reality of AI as Implementor

### **The Paradigm Shifts**

#### 1. **From Managing People to Orchestrating Agents**

**What's the Same:**
- Still need clear problem definition
- Still accountable for outcomes
- Still need to validate with users

**What's Different:**
- **Intent Specification > Task Assignment**: Instead of breaking down work for humans, you're crafting precise prompts and agent instructions
- **Continuous Availability**: Agents don't have working hours, meetings, or context-switching costs
- **Parallel Execution**: Can spawn multiple agents for parallel experimentation
- **No Skill Development Needed**: Agents come pre-trained; focus shifts to orchestration

#### 2. **From Waterfall Discovery to Continuous Experimentation**

**Traditional Flow:**
Discovery → Prototype → Test → Build → Ship

**Agentic Flow:**
Continuous loop of: Ideate → Specify → Deploy → Measure → Iterate
- **Speed**: Hours/days instead of weeks/months
- **Cost**: Near-zero marginal cost for experiments
- **Scale**: Can run hundreds of variations simultaneously

#### 3. **From Static Products to Adaptive Systems**

**What Changes:**
- Products can self-modify based on user behavior
- Agents can personalize experiences in real-time
- Continuous learning from every interaction
- Products become "living systems" not fixed releases

### **New Core Competencies for Agentic PMs**

#### 1. **Prompt Engineering & Intent Specification**
- **Skill**: Translating ambiguous business needs into precise agent instructions
- **Key Practice**: Building prompt libraries and templates
- **Success Pattern**: Start broad, iterate to specific based on agent outputs

#### 2. **Agent Orchestration & Workflow Design**
- **Skill**: Designing multi-agent systems and handoffs
- **Key Practice**: Mapping agent capabilities to user journeys
- **Success Pattern**: Single agent → Multi-agent collaboration → Autonomous workflows

#### 3. **Evaluation & Guardrail Design**
- **Skill**: Creating evaluation frameworks for agent outputs
- **Key Practice**: Building test suites and quality gates
- **Success Pattern**: Human-in-the-loop → Automated evaluation → Self-improving systems

#### 4. **Rapid Iteration Management**
- **Skill**: Managing extremely fast development cycles
- **Key Practice**: Real-time monitoring and adjustment
- **Success Pattern**: Launch → Learn → Adjust (in hours, not sprints)

**The successful Agentic Product Manager will:**
1. Master intent specification and prompt engineering
2. Design agent workflows and orchestration
3. Build evaluation frameworks and guardrails
4. Embrace continuous experimentation
5. Progressively delegate to autonomous systems

**The opportunity is massive:** We're moving from a world where building products took months and millions to one where it takes days and dollars. The winners will be those who can effectively bridge timeless product principles with the new capabilities of agentic systems.

**Your students will leave equipped to:**
- Identify opportunities perfect for agentic development
- Translate business needs into agent specifications
- Build and deploy products 10-100x faster
