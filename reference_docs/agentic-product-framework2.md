# Product Thinking for Agentic Development
## From Human Craft to Agent Orchestration

## Part 1: The Eternal Core of Product Thinking
### What Great Product Builders Have Always Known

### **The Primacy of Taste**

#### Steve Jobs on Taste
"Ultimately, it comes down to taste. It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things into what you're doing."

**What Taste Really Means:**
- **Not Subjective Preference**: "You feel this when you start to design things. Once you start to examine the question, it's surprising how much different fields' ideas of beauty have in common."
- **Calibrated Judgment**: The ability to recognize quality and make thousands of micro-decisions that compound into excellence
- **Cross-Disciplinary Pattern Recognition**: Drawing from art, science, humanities to inform product decisions
- **Stubborn Standards**: "I don't think my taste in aesthetics is that much different than a lot of other people's. The difference is that I just get to be really stubborn about making things as good as we all know they can be."

#### How to Develop Taste (The Jobs/Rubin Method)
1. **Expose yourself to excellence** across domains
2. **Study why great things work** - dissect and understand
3. **Practice making judgments** and see what succeeds
4. **Build your internal meter** for quality
5. **Stay stubborn** about your standards

### **Jobs-to-be-Done: The Foundation of Product Thinking**

#### The Core Insight
"People don't simply buy or pick products or services; they pull them into their lives to make progress." Products are hired to do jobs - functional, emotional, and social.

#### The Three Dimensions of Every Job
1. **Functional**: The practical task to accomplish
2. **Emotional**: How the customer wants to feel
3. **Social**: How the customer wants to be perceived

#### Why JTBD Matters More Than Demographics
"Here I am, Clayton Christensen. I'm sixty-four years old. I'm six feet eight inches tall... But these characteristics have not yet caused me to go out and buy the New York Times today." Demographics don't cause purchases - jobs do.

### **Continuous Discovery: The Modern Product Discipline**

#### Teresa Torres' Core Framework
"Continuous discovery as weekly touch points with customers, by the team building the products, where they conduct small research activities, in pursuit of a desired product outcome."

#### The Opportunity Solution Tree
- **Start with Outcomes** not outputs
- **Map the Opportunity Space** - all the ways to achieve the outcome
- **Generate Multiple Solutions** for each opportunity
- **Test Assumptions** rapidly and cheaply
- **Iterate Based on Learning** not opinion

#### The Anti-Pattern to Avoid
"Many teams chase frameworks, tools, and methodologies, hoping that each new innovation will suddenly unlock the door to product success. However, for most frameworks, tools, and methodologies to be successful, it's not just your tactics that need to change but also your mindset."

### **The Four Universal Product Risks**
Every product decision must navigate:

1. **Desirability Risk**: Do people want this?
2. **Viability Risk**: Can we sustain this as a business?
3. **Feasibility Risk**: Can we actually build and maintain this?
4. **Usability Risk**: Can people successfully use this?

### **Paul Graham's "Do Things That Don't Scale"**
Early product success comes from:
- **Manual intervention** to deeply understand the job
- **Excessive attention** to early users
- **Learning through inefficiency** before automating
- **Building taste** through direct experience

## Part 2: The Craft of Opportunity Assessment
### Eternal Questions for Product Judgment

### **The Jobs-to-be-Done Assessment**

Before building anything, understand:

1. **What job are people hiring this for?**
   - Functional progress they're trying to make
   - Emotional states they're seeking
   - Social signals they want to send

2. **What are they firing to hire this?**
   - Current solutions (including "do nothing")
   - Why those solutions fail
   - The switching costs (functional and emotional)

3. **When does this job arise?**
   - Triggering circumstances
   - Frequency and urgency
   - Context and constraints

4. **How will we know we've done the job well?**
   - Customer-defined success metrics
   - Observable behavior changes
   - Willingness to pay/recommend

### **The Taste Assessment**

Ask yourself honestly:

1. **Is this something you would use?**
   - Not "would you build it" but "would you hire it"
   - Does it meet your own quality bar?

2. **Is it 10x better at the job?**
   - Not marginally better - dramatically better
   - Worth the switching cost

3. **Does it have an opinion?**
   - Strong point of view about how the job should be done
   - Willing to say "no" to preserve quality

4. **Is it simple at its core?**
   - Can you explain it in one sentence?
   - Does it do one job exceptionally well?

### **The Continuous Discovery Assessment**

Before committing to build:

1. **Have we tested our riskiest assumptions?**
   - Build-measure-learn cycles completed
   - Evidence from real users, not opinions

2. **Do we have a clear learning agenda?**
   - What we need to learn next
   - How we'll learn it efficiently

3. **Have we explored multiple solutions?**
   - Not falling in love with first idea
   - Comparing approaches objectively

## Part 3: What Changes with Agentic Development
### The New Reality of Infinite Building Capacity

### **The Fundamental Shifts**

#### 1. **From Resource-Constrained to Taste-Constrained**

**Traditional Constraint**: "We can only build so much"
**Agentic Reality**: "We can build anything - but should we?"

**What This Means**:
- Taste becomes THE differentiator
- Curation > Creation
- Judgment > Execution
- "No" becomes more important than "Yes"

#### 2. **From Sequential Discovery to Parallel Experimentation**

**Agentic**: Everything simultaneously

**New Capabilities**:
- Run 100 experiments in parallel
- Test every assumption concurrently
- Build multiple complete solutions to compare
- Learn from production-quality prototypes

#### 3. **From Static Products to Living Systems**

**Traditional**: Ship and iterate quarterly
**Agentic**: Continuous adaptation

**Product as Organism**:
- Self-improving based on usage
- Personalizing to individual jobs
- Evolving without human intervention
- Learning from every interaction

## Part 6: The Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### **Pitfall 1: Optimizing Metrics Over Taste**
- **Problem**: Agents maximize what's measured, missing quality
- **Solution**: Make taste explicit in evaluation criteria

### **Pitfall 2: Infinite Building Without Judgment**
- **Problem**: Building everything because you can
- **Solution**: Strengthen "no" muscle, fewer better things

### **Pitfall 3: Losing Touch with the Job**
- **Problem**: Building features not hiring solutions
- **Solution**: Continuous job discovery, measure job success

### **Pitfall 4: Taste Drift Through Automation**
- **Problem**: Quality degrades as system evolves
- **Solution**: Taste boundaries and regular calibration

### **Pitfall 5: Forgetting "Do Things That Don't Scale"**
- **Problem**: Automating before understanding
- **Solution**: Manual first, automate after

## Conclusion: The New Product Creator

**The eternal truths remain:**
- Taste is the ultimate differentiator
- Products are hired to do jobs
- Discovery beats opinion
- Simple beats complex
- Quality compounds

**But everything about execution changes:**
- From building to curating
- From sequential to parallel
- From static to evolving
- From resource-constrained to taste-constrained

**The winning Product Creator will:**
1. **Cultivate exceptional taste** across domains
2. **Master job discovery** through behavior
3. **Articulate quality** in ways agents understand
4. **Orchestrate parallel experimentation** at scale
5. **Build living products** that improve themselves

**The opportunity is transformational:** We're moving from a world where great products were limited by building capacity to one where they're only limited by taste and judgment. The builders who combine timeless product thinking with agentic execution will create products of unprecedented quality at unprecedented speed.

**Your students will leave knowing how to:**
- Develop and articulate product taste
- Discover real jobs through behavior
- Translate quality into specifications
- Orchestrate agents to explore solution spaces
- Build products that evolve while preserving excellence

The future belongs not to those who can build (agents do that), but to those who know what's worth building and why. **Product thinking becomes more important, not less, when building becomes infinite.**
