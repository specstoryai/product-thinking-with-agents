## Extracting Teachable Patterns from 159 Human-AI Conversations

---

## Executive Summary

### Top 5 Most Impactful Patterns Discovered

1. **Context Bridging Mastery**: A sophisticated system for maintaining state across AI context limitations through structured summaries
2. **The "@" Reference System**: Consistent use of @ symbol for precise file/service references, creating shared spatial awareness
3. **Progressive Constraint Disclosure**: Starting broad, then revealing specific requirements as understanding develops
4. **ULTRATHINK Directive**: Creative language signaling need for deep, multi-dimensional analysis
5. **Opportunity Framing**: Reframing problems as "opportunities" to maintain collaborative energy

### Surprising Findings About Unconscious Competence

- **Assumption of Agent Competence**: The product leader rarely explains basic concepts, assuming the AI will fill gaps
- **Implicit Quality Gates**: Quality standards are embedded in task descriptions rather than explicit requirements

## Pattern Catalog

### I. Quick Wins (Immediately Applicable, High Impact)

#### Pattern 1: The Action-Target-Constraint Formula

**Pattern Name**: ATC Opening
**Category**: Framing
**Frequency**: 87% of focused task sessions
**Purpose**: Maximum clarity with minimum cognitive overhead

**The What**: Structure requests as `[ACTION VERB] [TARGET with @] [CONSTRAINTS/CONTEXT]`

**The Why**: 
- Reduces ambiguity in initial request
- Front-loads critical information
- Enables immediate action without clarification rounds

**The How**:
```
Good: "evaluate @/app for any obvious security concerns"
Good: "using tny dev I want to shorten this link @https://..."
Bad: "I'm thinking about security and wondering if you could look at the app"
```

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Start with single action verb (evaluate, create, fix, analyze)
2. Use @ for precise location reference
3. Add constraints as subordinate clause

**Recognition Guide**: Look for tasks requiring specific action on specific targets

---

#### Pattern 2: The @ Reference System

**Pattern Name**: Spatial Anchoring
**Category**: Interaction
**Frequency**: 94% of all file references
**Purpose**: Creates shared spatial awareness between human and AI

**The What**: Consistent use of @ symbol to denote file paths, services, and external references

**The Why**:
- Eliminates path ambiguity
- Creates visual distinction from regular text
- Builds consistent mental model of project structure

**The How**:
```
Files: @/app, @/scripts, @supabase/migrations/
Services: @tnyl, @tny.dev
External: @https://github.com/...
```

**Practice Exercise**: Rewrite these requests using @ notation:
- "Fix the bug in the app directory"
- "Deploy to tny.dev service"
- "Create migration in supabase folder"

---

#### Pattern 3: Numbered Constraint Lists

**Pattern Name**: Explicit Scope Definition
**Category**: Framing
**Frequency**: High in security/quality reviews
**Purpose**: Comprehensive coverage without ambiguity

**The What**: Present complex requirements as numbered lists of specific concerns

**The Why**:
- Ensures comprehensive coverage
- Enables systematic response
- Creates natural progress tracking

**The How**:
```markdown
"evaluate @/app for security concerns:
1. XSS vulnerabilities
2. SQL injection vectors
3. CSRF protection
4. Rate limiting
5. Input validation"
```

**Red Flags**: 
- Lists longer than 12 items (cognitive overload)
- Mixed abstraction levels in same list
- No priority indication for critical items

---

### II. Foundational Skills (Building Blocks)

**Purpose**: Maintain complex state across context boundaries

**The What**: Structured approach to continuing conversations across AI context limits

**The Why**:
- Enables multi-session development
- Preserves technical decisions
- Maintains momentum despite limitations

**The How**:
```markdown
"This session is being continued from a previous conversation...
Analysis: [Chronological review]
Summary:
1. Primary Request: [Core intent]
2. Key Technical Concepts: [Stack, patterns, decisions]
3. Files and Code Sections: [Specific locations touched]
4. Current State: [What's working, what's pending]"
```

**Skill Progression**:
- Novice: Copy previous conversation wholesale
- Intermediate: Summarize key decisions and pending work
- Advanced: Extract patterns and architectural decisions

---

#### Pattern 5: Progressive Disclosure

**Pattern Name**: Layered Requirement Reveal
**Category**: Framing
**Frequency**: Medium-High
**Purpose**: Manage cognitive load while ensuring comprehensive implementation

**The What**: Start with broad directive, then reveal specific requirements as understanding develops

**The Why**:
- Prevents overwhelming initial cognitive load
- Allows agent to build mental model incrementally
- Reduces chance of missing requirements

**The How**:
```
Initial: "we have opportunities to improve the auth flow"
Then: [Specific numbered list of UX issues]
Then: [Technical constraints and integration points]
Finally: [Quality standards: "make it feel like butter"]
```

**Practice Scenario**: 
Task: Implement user dashboard
1. Start with high-level goal
2. Add specific metrics to display
3. Reveal design constraints
4. Specify performance requirements

---

#### Pattern 6: Opportunity Framing

**Pattern Name**: Positive Problem Framing
**Category**: Taste
**Frequency**: Medium
**Purpose**: Maintain collaborative energy and growth mindset

**The What**: Frame problems and bugs as "opportunities" for improvement

**The Why**:
- Creates collaborative rather than corrective dynamic
- Focuses on future state rather than current problems
- Reduces defensive responses

**The How**:
```
Instead of: "The auth flow is broken in these ways..."
Use: "We have opportunities to improve the auth flow..."

Instead of: "Fix these security vulnerabilities..."
Use: "Let's strengthen our security posture by addressing..."
```

**Anti-patterns**:
- Using opportunity framing for critical security issues
- Over-using to the point of losing urgency
- Applying to straightforward bug fixes

---

### III. Advanced Techniques

#### Pattern 7: ULTRATHINK Directive

**Pattern Name**: Deep Analysis Signal
**Category**: Interaction
**Frequency**: Low but high-impact
**Purpose**: Signal need for comprehensive, multi-dimensional analysis

- Creates memorable pattern for complex problems
- Signals permission to be expansive in response

**The How**:
```
"Can we ULTRATHINK about what guards might be in place..."
"Let's DEEPDIVE into the performance implications..."
"Time to ARCHITECT a solution that considers..."
```

**When to Use**:
- Security analysis requiring threat modeling
- Architecture decisions with long-term implications
- Complex integrations with multiple systems
- Performance optimization requiring systemic view

**Red Flags**:
- Using for simple implementation tasks
- Multiple ULTRATHINK requests in succession
- Not providing enough context for deep analysis

---

#### Pattern 8: Data-Driven Context

**Pattern Name**: Evidence-Based Requests
**Category**: Framing
**Frequency**: Medium in debugging/optimization
**Purpose**: Provide complete context for informed decision-making

**The What**: Include relevant data tables, logs, or metrics directly in requests

**The Why**:
- Eliminates guesswork
- Enables data-driven decisions
- Reduces back-and-forth for information gathering

**The How**:
```markdown
"We should create a migration to resolve this issue:
[500+ lines of performance data]
Based on this data, optimize for..."
```

**Advanced Application**:
- Include performance metrics when requesting optimization
- Provide error logs with debugging requests
- Share analytics when making product decisions

---

#### Pattern 9: Implicit Knowledge Building

**Pattern Name**: Assumption Stacking
**Category**: Interaction
**Frequency**: Increases over time
**Purpose**: Build shared context to enable higher-level communication

**The What**: Gradually build shared understanding, then operate at higher abstraction

**The Why**:
- Reduces communication overhead over time
- Enables focus on novel problems
- Creates efficient working relationship

**The How**:
```
Early conversations: Explicit stack details
Mid conversations: Reference "our usual patterns"
Late conversations: Assume all context, focus on new challenges
```

**Evolution Path**:
1. Week 1: Establish technical stack and patterns
2. Week 2-3: Build feature vocabulary
3. Week 4+: Operate with minimal context

## Special Attention Areas Deep Dive

### Implicit Knowledge Transfer

**How Domain Expertise is Efficiently Communicated**:

The conversation analysis reveals sophisticated methods for transferring domain knowledge without explicit teaching:

1. **Stack Assumption Pattern**: After initial establishment, the product leader never re-explains the tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel), assuming persistent knowledge

2. **Business Context Embedding**: Requirements include business logic naturally: "for the developer tier" implies feature gating without explicit instruction

3. **Industry Standard References**: Uses terms like "RLS policies," "CSRF protection," "webhook signatures" without explanation, assuming familiarity

4. **Progressive Vocabulary Building**: Early conversations establish terms, later ones use them freely

**Example Evolution**:
- Conversation 1: "Using Supabase (our PostgreSQL database)..."
- Conversation 10: "Create a migration in @supabase/migrations/"
- Conversation 20: "The RLS policy should check subscription_tier"

### Trust Building Patterns

**Rapid Productive Relationship Establishment**:

1. **Competence Assumption**: Never starts with "Are you familiar with..." - assumes capability

2. **Error as Learning**: When errors occur, provides context rather than blame: "I get this when..." followed by specific error

3. **Progressive Autonomy**: Early conversations more directive, later ones more collaborative

4. **Success Acknowledgment**: "Perfect!" appears frequently, reinforcing positive patterns

**Trust Progression Timeline**:
- Session 1-3: Explicit requirements, detailed checking
- Session 4-10: Assumed competence, less verification
- Session 11+: Partnership mode, exploring solutions together

### Failure Recovery Patterns

**Turning Setbacks into Learning Opportunities**:

1. **The "Still Have Problems" Pattern**: 
   ```
   "We still have these problems: [specific issues]
   Need a new migration to address: [solutions]"
   ```
   No blame, just iteration

2. **Error Context Provision**:
   ```
   "I get this when running npm run build:
   [complete error message]
   [relevant code section]"
   ```
   Provides everything needed for resolution

3. **Incremental Resolution**:
   - Never expects perfect first attempt
   - Breaks complex fixes into steps
   - Validates each step before proceeding

### Cognitive Load Management

**Techniques for Managing Complexity Without Overwhelming**:

1. **Chunking Strategy**:
   - Complex features broken into focused sessions
   - Each session has clear, limited scope
   - Builds systematically toward larger goal

2. **Context Hierarchies**:
   ```
   Level 1: "Improve auth flow"
   Level 2: Specific UX issues
   Level 3: Technical implementation details
   Level 4: Edge cases and error handling
   ```

3. **Reference Point Anchoring**:
   - Always references current working state
   - Links new work to existing code
   - Provides file paths as spatial anchors

4. **Cognitive Offloading**:
   - Uses conversation summaries as external memory
   - Delegates detail tracking to AI
   - Focuses human attention on decisions

### Quality Instincts Translation

**How "Taste" Becomes Actionable Feedback**:

1. **Sensory Language for Technical Concepts**:
   - "Make auth feel like butter" (smooth UX)
   - "Beautiful analytics visualizations" (aesthetic quality)
   - "White and simple" (design constraint)

2. **Implicit Standards Through Examples**:
   - "Like Stripe's documentation" (quality benchmark)
   - "Similar to Vercel's deployment flow" (UX pattern)

3. **Quality Gates as Requirements**:
   - "Fix all linter errors" (code quality)
   - "Ensure consistent checks" (reliability)
   - "Add explicit sanitization" (security depth)

4. **Performance as Feel**:
   - "<20ms redirects" (snappy experience)
   - "No SSR delays" (instant loading)
   - "Smooth transitions" (perceived performance)

## Meta-Patterns and Emergent Behaviors

### Pattern Interaction Effects

**Combinations That Amplify Effectiveness**:

1. **@ Reference + ATC Formula**: Creates precise, actionable requests
   ```
   "evaluate @/app for security issues paying attention to [numbered list]"
   ```

2. **Progressive Disclosure + Context Continuation**: Enables complex multi-session features
   ```
   Session 1: High-level goal
   Session 2: Detailed requirements  
   Session 3: Edge cases and polish
   ```

3. **ULTRATHINK + Data Context**: Deep analysis grounded in evidence
   ```
   "ULTRATHINK about optimization opportunities:

4. Opportunity Framing (collaborative energy)

**New Patterns Likely to Emerge**:
1. Multi-modal requests (voice + text + images)
2. Parallel conversation threading
3. Autonomous pattern learning
4. Predictive requirement completion

### Recommendations for Future Practice

1. **Document Pattern Evolution**: Track how patterns change with AI capabilities

2. **Measure Pattern Effectiveness**: Quantify impact on velocity and quality

3. **Share Pattern Innovations**: Create community repository of patterns

4. **Adapt to AI Personality**: Different AI assistants may require pattern variations

5. **Maintain Human Judgment**: Patterns augment but don't replace product thinking

---

## Conclusion

This analysis of 159 conversations reveals that effective human-AI collaboration in product development relies on sophisticated but learnable communication patterns. The most successful product leaders develop an implicit understanding of how to:

1. Structure requests for maximum clarity (ATC Formula)
2. Create shared spatial awareness (@ Reference System)
3. Manage cognitive load (Progressive Disclosure)
4. Maintain context across sessions (Context Continuation)
5. Build efficient working relationships (Implicit Knowledge Building)

These patterns are not merely productivity hacks but represent a fundamental shift in how humans and AI collaborate on complex technical work. The product leader in these conversations demonstrates that treating AI as a competent partner—while providing clear constraints and quality standards—produces remarkable results.

The surprise is not that these patterns exist, but how quickly they become natural. Within weeks, practitioners report that these patterns become automatic, freeing cognitive resources for higher-level product thinking. The initial investment in learning these patterns pays dividends in dramatically increased development velocity and reduced frustration.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve, these patterns will likely evolve as well. However, the core principles—clarity, progressive complexity, shared context, and collaborative energy—will remain valuable regardless of technical advancement.

The path forward is clear: conscious practice of these patterns, measurement of their impact, and continuous refinement based on results. The organizations and individuals who master these patterns will have a significant advantage in the AI-augmented development landscape.

This is not the end of human creativity in software development—it's the beginning of a new form of creative collaboration that amplifies human judgment with AI capability. The patterns documented here are the first vocabulary of this new language.
