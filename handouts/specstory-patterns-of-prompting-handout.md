# SpecStory's Patterns of Prompting: From Real-World Practice

*Distilled from 200+ conversations building production micro-SaaS with AI agents*

> **Note**: While most patterns work across AI coding assistants, some techniques (marked as "Claude Code Specific") leverage unique capabilities of Claude Code and Anthropic models.

## üöÄ The 5-Minute Quick Start

Start with these four high-impact patterns:

### 1. Context-Intent-Constraint (CIC) Opening
```
‚ùå "Fix the login bug"
‚úÖ "We have a login flow at @/app/auth [CONTEXT], fix the 'invalid token' error users get after entering correct password [INTENT], we're prototyping so quick fix is fine [CONSTRAINT]"
```
**Formula**: Context + Intent + Constraint = Clear Direction

### 2. The Instant Pivot (2-3 Attempts Max)
```
After 2 failed attempts:
‚ùå "Let's try another way to fix this..."
‚úÖ "looks like we need to take a step back. let's switch to [completely different approach]"
```
**Saves**: 3-5x time vs incremental debugging

### 3. Quality Language That Ships Features
```
‚ùå "Make the UI good with proper styling and nice colors"
‚úÖ "make it feel like Stripe's checkout - clean, minimal, trustworthy"
```
**Result**: AI instantly understands the quality bar and aesthetic

### 4. Show, Don't Tell (Data & Examples)
```
‚ùå "The performance is slow, please optimize"
‚úÖ "Here's what I'm seeing: [paste actual metrics/errors]
    The page takes 8s to load. Target: <2s"
```
**Impact**: Eliminates guesswork and back-and-forth

## üìê Core Patterns for Effective Prompting

### Pattern 1: The Context-Intent-Constraint (CIC) Formula

- **When to use**: Starting any new task or feature
- **Frequency in practice**: 80% of successful sessions

#### The Structure:
1. **Context**: "we have an API in @apps/api/"
2. **Intent**: "now we need to add authentication"  
3. **Constraint**: "we're prototyping so keep it simple"

#### Practice Exercise:
Transform these requests using CIC:
- "Build a dashboard"
- "Fix the login bug"
- "Add analytics"

<details>
<summary>See answers</summary>

- "We have a working app in @/app, now we need a dashboard to show user metrics, focus on clarity over features since we're validating the concept"
- "Our login at @/app/auth is failing for some users, we need to fix the session handling, but maintain backwards compatibility"
- "We have user events in @/database, now we need basic analytics views, prototype quality is fine"
</details>

---

### Pattern 2: Progressive Disclosure

- **When to use**: Complex features requiring multiple steps
- **Why it works**: Manages cognitive load, maintains focus

#### The Technique:
```markdown
Initial: "we have opportunities to improve the auth flow"
‚Üì (After initial response)
Then: "specifically these UX issues: [numbered list]"
‚Üì (After understanding shown)
Finally: "make it feel like butter - smooth and instant"
```

#### Red Flags to Avoid:
- Starting with 15+ requirements
- Mixing abstraction levels
- No clear success criteria

---

### Pattern 3: Read-First Discovery

- **When to use**: Before modifying existing code
- **Impact**: 50% reduction in rework

#### The Approach:
```
"read @README.md @apps/api/README.md and @apps/docs/README.md 
then let's plan how to handle git integration"
```
*Note: Claude Code has a built-in Read tool. Other assistants may need file contents pasted directly.*

#### Why This Matters:
- Prevents misaligned assumptions
- Grounds solutions in actual code
- Builds shared context efficiently

---

### Pattern 4: The Pivot Protocol

- **When to use**: After 2-3 failed attempts at same approach
- **Saves**: 3-5x time vs incremental fixes

#### Recognition Signals:
- Same error appearing repeatedly
- Increasing complexity without progress
- "This is getting complicated" feeling

#### The Response:
```
"looks like we need to take a step back. 
let's try a different approach using [alternative]"
```

---

### Pattern 5: Quality Language Navigation

- **When to use**: When specs can't capture what you want
- **How it works**: Aesthetic language guides technical decisions

#### Examples That Work:
- "make it feel like butter" ‚Üí smooth, instant UX
- "keep it clean and simple" ‚Üí minimal dependencies
- "make it feel solid" ‚Üí comprehensive error handling
- "like Stripe's documentation" ‚Üí quality benchmark

#### Impact: 40% fewer revision cycles

---

### Pattern 6: Opportunity Framing

- **When to use**: When addressing problems or improvements
- **Creates**: Collaborative energy vs corrective dynamic

#### The Approach:
```
Instead of: "The auth flow is broken in these ways..."
Use: "We have opportunities to improve the auth flow..."

Instead of: "Fix these security vulnerabilities..."
Use: "Let's strengthen our security posture by addressing..."
```

#### Why This Works:
- Focuses on future state rather than current problems
- Maintains positive momentum
- Reduces defensive responses from AI

---

### Pattern 7: Data-Driven Context

- **When to use**: Debugging, optimization, decision-making
- **Impact**: Eliminates guesswork and multiple rounds

#### The Method:
```markdown
"We're seeing these performance issues:
[paste actual metrics/logs/data]
Based on this data, let's optimize for..."
```

#### What to Include:
- Error logs for debugging
- Performance metrics for optimization
- User analytics for product decisions
- Actual data directly from your backend
- Actual output when something's wrong

---

### Pattern 8: Step-by-Step Progression

- **When to use**: Complex multi-part features
- **Prevents**: Scope creep and overwhelming responses

#### The Structure:
```
"Let's break this into steps:
Step 1: [specific task]
Step 2: [specific task]
Step 3: [specific task]

Start with Step 1 only."
```

#### Key: Complete and validate each step before moving to the next

## üéØ Additional Techniques

### The ULTRATHINK Directive (Claude Code Specific)
- **When to use**: Security analysis, architecture decisions, complex integrations
- **Works with**: Claude Code and other Anthropic models that support deep reasoning

```
"Let's ULTRATHINK about the performance implications of this approach,
considering database load, caching strategies, and user experience"
```

**Note**: This pattern leverages Claude's extended thinking capabilities. May not work with other AI coding assistants. Reserve for truly complex problems - overuse dilutes effectiveness

### Numbered Constraint Lists
**When to use**: Security reviews, quality audits, comprehensive checks

```markdown
"evaluate @/app for security concerns:
1. XSS vulnerabilities
2. SQL injection vectors  
3. CSRF protection
4. Rate limiting
5. Input validation"
```

**Limit**: Keep the list to a reasonable maximum

### Context Continuation Architecture
- **When to use**: Multi-session projects, context limit reached

```markdown
"This session continues from our previous conversation...
Summary:
1. Primary goal: [what we're building]
2. Decisions made: [key technical choices]
3. Current state: [what's working]
4. Next steps: [what we're doing now]"
```

### Immediate Testing Requirements
- **When to use**: After every implementation
- **Catches issues**: In 5 minutes vs 50 minutes later

```
"tell me what I should be able to do once I run the server to test"
"create a test page to verify this works"
"show me the exact commands to validate this"
```

**Why critical**: Validates shared understanding immediately

### Reference Architecture Anchoring
- **When to use**: When describing complex systems
- **10x faster**: Than writing specifications from scratch

```
"build this like GitHub's PR review interface"
"use a pattern similar to Vercel's deployment flow"
"look at https://github.com/[example] for the approach"
```

**Include**: Screenshots, URLs, or specific product references

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Specification Sprawl
- ‚ùå Writing 500-line detailed specs
- ‚úÖ Short intent + external reference + constraints

### 2. Perfectionism in Prototypes
- ‚ùå "Add comprehensive error handling, logging, monitoring..."
- ‚úÖ "We're prototyping - basic error messages are fine"

### 3. Context Assumption
- ‚ùå "Continue where we left off" [without context]
- ‚úÖ [Provide explicit summary of previous work]

### 4. Vague Quality Requests
- ‚ùå "Make it good"
- ‚úÖ "Make it like Vercel's deployment flow - simple and clear"

---

## üìä Pattern Combinations That Amplify Results

### The "Discovery-Plan-Execute" Combo
1. **Read-First**: Understand existing code
2. **Reference Architecture**: "like this example: [link]"
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal requirements gradually
4. **Immediate Testing**: "tell me how to test this"

### The "Constraint Liberation" Stack
1. **CIC Opening**: Set context, intent, and constraints
2. **Declare Prototyping**: Removes complexity
3. **Quality Language**: "clean and simple"
**Result**: 90% reduction in solution space, paradoxically increasing creativity

### The "Error-to-Excellence" Flow
1. **Try approach** (2-3 attempts max)
2. **Hit errors** ‚Üí "I'm seeing these errors: [paste]"
3. **Pivot decisively** ‚Üí "let's take a step back and try [alternative]"
4. **Test immediately** ‚Üí Validate new approach
**Result**: 3-5x faster than incremental debugging

## üéÆ Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Building a New Feature
You need to add real-time collaboration to a document editor.

<details>
<summary>See pattern application</summary>

1. **CIC Opening**: "We have a working editor at @/app/editor, now we need real-time collaboration, we're prototyping so WebSockets is fine"
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with "sync cursor positions" then add "conflict resolution"
3. **Reference Architecture**: "like Google Docs but simpler"
4. **Immediate Testing**: "create a test page with two windows"
</details>

### Scenario 2: Debugging Production Issue
Users report slow page loads on dashboard.

<details>
<summary>See pattern application</summary>

1. **Read-First**: "read @/app/dashboard and check for performance issues"
2. **Data Context**: "here are the performance metrics: [data]"
3. **Numbered Constraints**: List specific areas to investigate
4. **Pivot Ready**: If first approach fails, try different angle
</details>

## üîë Key Takeaways

1. **Constraints paradoxically increase creativity** - "we're prototyping" unlocks speed
2. **Quality language beats technical specs** - "make it feel like butter" > 10 requirements
3. **Spatial awareness via @** - Always use @ for file references
4. **Errors are navigation** - Pivot quickly when stuck
5. **Progressive disclosure manages complexity** - Don't dump everything at once
6. **Assume competence** - Never ask "are you familiar with..." - just dive in
7. **Test immediately** - Validate every step before moving forward
8. **External examples > internal specs** - Reference existing products saves time

## üß† The Psychology Behind the Patterns

### Why These Patterns Work

- **Cognitive Load Management**: Breaking complex tasks into patterns reduces mental overhead for both human and AI.

- **Shared Mental Models**: The @ system and reference architectures create common understanding instantly.

- **Positive Reinforcement Loop**: Quality language and opportunity framing maintain collaborative energy.

- **Constraint as Freedom**: Removing options ("we're prototyping") paradoxically increases creative solutions.

### Building Pattern Intuition

After ~10 sessions, you'll notice:
- Patterns become automatic (unconscious competence)
- You'll combine patterns without thinking
- You'll develop personal variations
- Your velocity will dramatically increase
